We’re sure that a certain carmaker whose name starts with J will be foaming at the mouth because there’s no denying how much this new Thar looks like a Wrangler two door. But design rights aside, the Thar is a very tough and modern-looking SUV with even more road presence than before.', '', 'On our drive through the streets of Mumbai, there wasn’t a single motorist who wasn’t checking it out or giving it some very excited thumbs up. Every panel is now chunkier, the new 18-inch wheels have been very smartly designed, and the car itself has grown in terms of length (+65mm), width (129mm) and wheelbase (+20mm). Interestingly, the overall height is shorter, especially if you get the hard top or convertible soft top.', '', 'But for all its modernities, it retains various old-school elements. You still get exposed door hinges for the removable doors, bonnet clamps mounted on either side of the hood, a modernised take on the old CJ series’ square tail lamps, and a tailgate-mounted spare wheel (alloy in the top end).', '', 'Even the front grille adds some retro, albeit, controversial charm and the front end seems to draw inspiration from the old Mahindra Armada Grand. While you do get fender-mounted LED DRLs, the headlights themselves use basic halogen bulbs as do the fog lamps. The most interesting bit is how Mahindra has been subtle with some things and over the top with others.', '', 'We liked the little easter eggs, like the Thar with two camels insignia on the front windshield and tree branch insignia on the rear windshield. But then, there’s no mistaking this car for anything else with ‘Thar’ branding on the front bumper, front fender, wheels, mirrors and tail lamps! Look at the rear end of the old Mahindra-SsangYong Rexton and you know that Mahindra’s obsession with badging is consistent.', '', 'A big plus this time around is the number of options. The base AX variant comes with a fixed soft top as standard, while the top-end LX can be had with either a fixed hard top or a convertible soft top. The latter two can be fitted to the base variant as options. Colour options on offer are Red Rage, Mystic Copper, Galaxy Grey, Aquamarine, Rocky Beige and Napoli Black. Unfortunately, there’s no white colour option which comes as a big surprise!'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/carNewsEditorImages/930x620/20200815_185554/25954/mahindra0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['This is possibly the biggest area of improvement in the new Thar. While the old Thar appealed to enthusiasts, your family would question its Rs 11.50 lakh on road price tag. Outside of an AC and a basic instrument cluster, you had essentially nothing, with budget hatchback interior quality to top.', '', 'So the new cabin is nothing short of a revolution. Climb in using the side step and you’re still welcomed with that badass driving position that overlooks the bonnet. But now, it’s accompanied by a brand new dashboard that both feels and looks well built and designed. In classic off-road SUV style, the dashboard is rather flat to keep you close to the windshield. The dashboard gets an IP54 waterproof rating and the cabin is washable with drain plugs provided too. However, with this rating, best avoid power washes and stick to a good old fashioned bucket and cloth.', '', 'The plastic quality feels thick, robust and thankfully, isn’t a mix and match of one too many textures. We particularly liked the serial number embossed on the front passenger’s side that’s part of more Thar branding on the inside (also seen on the seats and doors).', '', 'The interior layout is reasonably practical too with a large storage area ahead of the gear lever that hosts two USB ports, an AUX port and a 12V socket. There are also two cup holders between the front passengers.', '', 'Above all else, the severe ergonomic flaws of the old car have been largely corrected. The seatbelt is now usable even for very tall occupants, the steering and pedals aren’t misaligned anymore and reaching the air con, and the infotainment system or transfer case lever is easy. Basically, anyone can use a Thar now without having to deal with off-putting quirks.', '', 'That said, it isn’t flawless. The footwell offers no space to rest your left foot and it gets taxing even on short journeys. Even the automatic variants don’t offer a dead pedal and the central panel juts into the footwell, pushing your left foot inward and hampering comfort. This issue holds true for short and tall drivers alike.', '', 'Cabin space, though, is usable even for tall drivers with good headroom and knee room available. As standard, the Thar comes as a 6-seater with side-facing rear seats (like before) but is now also available as a 4-seater with front-facing rear seats (AX option and LX). You access the rear seats using a front seat backrest mounted release that pushes the front seat ahead. You then climb into the rear through the gap, which is wide enough for average sized users to get in with a little bend of the back.', '', 'It does work decently as a 4-seater but isn’t a rear seat charmer by any means. Four six footers can fit in with reasonable comfort, especially because there’s good headroom and shoulder room even at the rear. However, the foot room is compromised near the front seat rails and it makes the seating position awkward. To top it off, at least in the hardtop model, the rear windows don’t open at all. Fortunately, rear seat occupants do get large adjustable headrests and roll cage mounted 3 point seatbelts. And yes, the rear seats do fold down.', 'Technology', 'The amenities list is far better now, considering you actually have features to talk about! The new Thar gets front power windows, electrically adjustable mirrors, tilt steering, a height-adjustable driver’s seat, steering-mounted audio/phone controls, and even cruise control!', '', 'It also gets remote keyless entry, a colour multi-information display, and a new 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and navigation. The touchscreen itself has some cool drive displays that show you roll and pitch angles, a compass, tyre position display, G monitor and more. It even gets a 6-speaker music system with two speakers and two tweeters mounted to the roof!'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20200817_194112/672/mahindra0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

Up front it appears imposing thanks to the high bonnet and puffed up panels. The LED daytime running lamps and projector headlamp placement reminds you of the Harrier and Tata designers have also added a tri-arrow pattern on the grille and lower half of the bumper which lends it some flair. In profile it definitely makes a case of it being an SUV thanks to the upright A-pillar and the height, which is more than even its bigger brother, the Nexon. There is no shortage of muscle too, just look at the flared wheel arches! In the top variant you also get a dual-tone paint job and the sharply cut 16-inch alloy wheels complete the look. On the lower variants you have to make do with 15-inch steel rims but in the one below the top Accomplished variant with the help of the option pack you can opt for the same 16-inch alloys along with projector headlamps, LED DRLs and blacked-out A-pillar. The rear design too is muscular and you will find the same tri-arrow pattern on the bumper but the highlight are the tail lamps. In the top variant, you get LED lighting and teardrop shape with the tri-arrow pattern which looks fantastic lit up.', '', ""What helps the Punch look even more imposing is the size. Compared to its competition it is wider and taller and is just a bit shorter in length than the Maruti Swift. In fact, heightwise, compared to the Nexon it is taller and slightly smaller on other parameters. Even when you look at its 190mm of ground clearance it's as if this car is trying to convince you of being an SUV rather than a hatchback.""], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20211009_082506/741/tata0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'Compared to the shouty and in-your-face exterior design, the Punch’s interior looks a lot simpler yet modern and classy. Thanks to minimal physical buttons on the centre console the dash design looks clean and the white panel gives it a nice flow and also helps the cabin seem wider than it is. The floating 7-inch display is placed high on the dashboard which makes it easy to use even on the move as it comes just below your eye line.', '', 'Speaking of quality, which traditionally is a weakness of Tata vehicles, it seems to have changed with the Punch. Of course like its rivals the Punch also doesn’t get soft-touch plastics but the textures that Tata has used help it feel properly premium. The white panel on the dash, for example, has a fading tri-arrow pattern that looks unique and even the black insert above has an interesting texture that looks appealing and feels premium to the touch. Even the plastics used lower down on the dash have the same graining as the upper portion of the dash, which helps the quality look consistent across. The touchpoints too like the gear lever, power window buttons and stalks are well finished. The steering wheel is shared with the Altroz and its small diameter and chunky wrapped rim help it feel sporty.', '', 'Thanks to the low dash and window line visibility up front is good except the thick A-pillar does create a bit of a blind spot, especially while crossing junctions. In terms of driving position, like in the Altroz, the steering wheel is positioned slightly to the left from your body, which takes some getting used to. Apart from that, the long range of adjustment for the seat height and steering tilt help in finding your preferred driving position with ease.', '', 'In terms of comfort, the front seats are wide and well-contoured which make them comfortable even for long journeys. The back seat surprises you with the amount of space on offer. You get more than enough knee room, headroom and thanks to the high-mounted front seats you get loads of foot room to stretch and relax. The bench itself is well shaped with ample under-thigh support and the backrest angle is comfortable too. If we had to complain then it would be about the seat cushioning which is a bit too soft and you could experience a bit of discomfort over long journeys.', 'Practicality', '', ""In terms of practicality, front passengers will be happy. Up front you get a big glovebox with a separate compartment to keep the car manual and papers. Door pockets aren’t massive but are well designed and can accommodate a one-litre bottle with ease. You also get a mobile or wallet cubby on the right of the steering column and even below the centre console. The two cup holders behind the gear lever are well designed but they are placed a bit too behind as compared to the passengers-and that’s because you have to share them with the rear passengers ‘cause they don't get any! In the top-end variant, you do get a rear armrest but no cup holders and rear passengers don’t even get a USB or 12 V charging port. On the upside, you do get sizable door pockets and seatback pockets."", '', ""When it comes to boot space, in this price bracket you won’t get anything better. The 360-litre boot is well shaped, deep and can easily gobble up a weekend's worth of luggage with ease. The loading lip however is a bit high, which can make loading large and heavy items a pain. The rear seat folds to give you extra loading space when required but the seats don’t fold flat and there is a huge ridge to contain with."", 'Features and Safety', 'Pure', '', ""When it comes to features the base variant doesn't get much kit. It gets basic things like front power windows, tilt steering and body-coloured bumpers. But with the help of the option pack, you can get an audio system with steering-mounted controls fitted to the car."", 'Adventure', '', 'Next up, the Adventure variant adds important features like a USB charging port, electric ORVMs, all four power windows and remote keyless entry. With the help of the option pack, you can also add a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a 6 speaker sound system and a reversing camera.', 'Accomplished', '', ""With the Accomplished variant, you start to get some feel-good features like LED tail lamps, cruise control, height-adjustable driver's seat and push-button engine start. With the option pack, you can also add 16-inch alloy wheels, LED DRLs, projector headlamps and a blacked-out A-pillar."", 'Creative', '', 'In the top Creative variant, you start getting premium features like auto folding ORVMs, automatic climate control, 7-inch drivers display, and rear seat armrest. You also get some headline features like automatic headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, IRA connected car tech as an option and a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Unfortunately, the infotainment system feels a bit old as compared to the rest of the car. The screen resolution is not that great, the graphics feel a bit dated and the fact that you don’t get any physical buttons makes it all the more difficult to operate, especially on the move.', ''], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20211009_082904/741/tata0.jpg'}",5 Star,,,,,,,,,

Compared to the XUV300 which looked a bit sober and straightforward, the 3XO brings with it very unique design elements that are sure to make you give it a second glance.', '', 'There are understandable mixed opinions about the front-end design of the SUV. It’s dominated by C-shaped DRLs and a piano black grille with chrome accents. LED projector headlamps have been incorporated neatly into the face. The aggressive cuts on the bumper make the front of the 3XO look powerful.', 'At the side, it’s easy to draw a connection to the older XUV300. The top-spec AX7L model features 17-inch alloy wheels finished in a dual-tone scheme. Lower variants get 16-inch tyres either with wheel caps or alloy wheels.', '', 'The rear is our favorite angle of the new XUV3XO. The connected lighting element is sharp, and is sure to look great when the sun sets.', 'There are some intricate diamond details all around, such as the grille, tail lamp enclosures and roof rails. All these tiny elements bind the overall design together quite nicely.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6634812aebb83.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The exterior design might be all new, but the interior only has subtle changes. In fact, if you’re familiar with the recently updated XUV400, the design is identical. Mahindra has worked on redesigning the central area of the dashboard with a free-floating touchscreen and a simpler arrangement of the climate control buttons. This simple change has made a noticeable difference, making the cabin look modern and fresh.', '', 'Just like the exterior, you will notice tiny diamond-shaped details in the piano black accents used around the touchscreen. The quality of these piano black surfaces in particular isn’t great, but other than that, it would be tough to pinpoint quality misses in the 3XO’s cabin.', '', 'Mahindra has stuck to a black/white cabin theme. The quality of leatherette used on the seats and steering wheel feels good too. That said, do bear in mind that the lighter shades are a little tough to keep clean. The seats are quite prone to getting dirty. Mahindra has been generous with the use of soft touch leatherette wrap on the dashboard and the door pads. Paired with a simple double-stitch detail, the cabin looks upmarket and premium. Fit and finish is consistent throughout the cabin and there are no glaring misses anywhere.', 'From a practicality standpoint, the XUV 3XO has all bases covered. The door pads have usable bottle holders, there are a couple of cup holders in the centre stack and the glovebox is of decent size too. Rear occupants, too, get bottle holders in the doors and two cup holders in the central armrest.', 'The XUV300 has been a benchmark in terms of in-cabin space and the XUV 3XO continues to impress. At the front, the seats are well cushioned and have ample bolstering for the average Indian build. If you are on the heavier side, you might feel a lack of support around the shoulders. The driver’s seat is adjustable for height and the steering wheel has tilt-adjust functionality. It’s easy to find a comfortable driving position.', '', 'At the rear, kneeroom and foot room is impressive. A six footer can sit here comfortably with some room to spare. In fact, we managed to have a 6.5ft tall person fit behind a 6ft tall person comfortably. What’s surprising is that despite a panoramic sunroof, there’s no issue with headroom at the rear. The only concern is of underthigh support. The seat base is small and flat, which leads to you sitting in a slightly knees-up position. Mahindra could’ve also offered the option of reclining the rear seat for more comfort over longer drives.', 'The top-spec version of the XUV 3XO comes loaded with features.

Paying homage to the 500 are the new headlamps where the “C” shape is maintained by the LED DRLs. However, these pack an all-LED beam and the indicators are dynamic as well. Complementing these are more LEDs in the fog lamps, which also feature cornering lights. The headlamps flow in the slats of the grille which features an aggressive design. The bonnet too gets strong creases which adds muscle to the front look for the 700. Safe to say, you won't be confusing the XUV700 with anything on the road when you see one at night."", '', ""From the side, it again retains the body lines from the 500, especially the arch over the rear wheel. However, it is subtler this time around and looks better. Talking points, though, are the flush sitting door handles which, in this top X7 variant with the option pack, are motorised. They pop out when you unlock the door. If you are eying a lower variant, don't worry because there too you will get the same flush design, but the handles will pop out when you press them. And they work so well that the motorised ones end up looking gimmicky. The AdrenoX sticker touch, on the fender, should have been much smaller as it becomes an eyesore in the overall design."", '', ""Wheels on this AX7 variant are 18-inch dual-tone diamond-cut alloys which do suit the overall design well. Speaking of which, the proportions of the XUV700 are better this time around as the length and wheelbase have been increased, the width is the same and the height is a tad less. While you won't be able to notice those changes, the overall product does look better."", '', 'Same story at the back as well where the arrow-shaped LED taillamps steal the show, especially in the dark. The overall design is also subtler and looks cleaner. And the entire boot cover is made out of fibre, not metal. This helps to get the desired shape more easily and keep the weight low.', 'Overall, the XUV700 has an impressive road presence. Opinions on the looks are still divided but one thing is for sure, it will be noticed.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210818_090834/732/mahindra0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'Plush and clean. This might be the first Mahindra for which we can use these adjectives. The layout is dominated by the large infotainment panel but then the middle dash is wrapped in soft leather which feels nice to the touch. The hard plastic over it too has a good texture and the silver finish too complements the design. The steering wheel with the new Mahindra logo looks clean and the leather wrap is grippy too. Controls here, though, could have had a better tactile feel. Also, they are prone to accidental touches.', '', 'On the side, the door pads feature a faux wooden trim which does suit the cabin. It houses the Mercedes-esque powered seat controls because of which the door pads are\xa0kinked up and looks odd from the outside. The upholstery feels plush and the seats are very supportive too, with manually adjustable lumbar support. Plus, the armrests, both the centre and the door pad ones, are at the same height so you get a very comfortable cruising position. The steering further gets tilt and telescopic adjustment so that you can get into a comfortable driving position easily.', '', ""However, there are areas where the quality suffers a bit. In the centre console, the climate control switches, toggle switches and the rotary dial don't feel as well-appointed as the rest of the cabin. The auto-gear shifter too does not have lights to indicate\xa0which gear you are in. You will have to check that on the dashboard."", '', ""Before we talk about the highlight features in detail, let's have a look at all the features on offer. You get dual-zone climate control, auto headlamp and wipers, adaptive cruise control as part of the ADAS tech, large touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, wireless charger, a 12-speaker Sony sound system and a large panoramic sunroof. What you don’t get are ventilated seats, one-touch window operation for the three passengers, paddle shifters and an auto-dimming IRVM. While these feature misses won't affect the cabin experience, they seem an odd miss in such a tech loaded car."", '', 'The first major highlight is the AdrenoX powered displays. The two 10.25 inch displays have a proper tablet-like resolution. They look sharp and are fluid to use. Not just that, they are also feature-packed. The infotainment unit gets in-built navigation, wireless Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, other in-built apps like Zomato and JustDial, and even gets displays like a g-meter and a lap timer. Some of these features were not yet working and the overall system had a few bugs. However, Mahindra is still finetuning the system and has informed us that these software issues will be resolved before the SUV hits the market. There is also Alexa which works like any other car assistant, and can control vehicle functions like climate control, sunroof and music selection via voice commands. Plus, you can also pair it with your Alexa device at home, with which you can lock and unlock the car or start the AC.', '', ""You also get a very high-resolution 360-degree camera here where you can even switch to a 3D model. And this not only shows you the car model and its surroundings, but somehow shows you what's underneath the car! And inbuilt into this is a DVR or dashcam where you can record multiple views or whenever you brake hard or the emergency brake assist is activated, it records the file automatically and stores it for you."", '', 'Then comes the 12-speaker Sony sound system which sounds absolutely fantastic. The multiple 3D settings do create a positive change in sound and this has the potential to be the top in a segment that features competitors like Bose, JBL and Infinity.', '', 'The other half of the display panel is the 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster. This features different display modes which you can switch between depending on your mood, and the area in between the two digital dials can feature a host of information like audio, calls, navigation drive information, tyre pressure monitoring system and ADAS assistants. All of this can be controlled from the steering wheel.', '', 'In terms of cabin practicality, the XUV gets decently sized door pockets with a bottle and an umbrella holder. There is a wireless charging pad and another mobile slot in the centre console. The under-armrest storage is cooled and the glovebox is large and spacious. Plus, the glovebox opening and the grab handle folding is damped and adds a sophisticated touch.', 'Second row', '', 'Ingress to the second row can be a bit of a bother for the grandparents as the SUV is tall and there are no side steps. But once in, the seats are well cushioned and supportive. You do not feel the lack of under-thigh support and there is good legroom to stretch out. Knee and headroom too are ample and two tall passengers, one behind the other, can easily sit in the XUV700. Also, because the window line is low and the upholstery light, the cabin feels quite airy. Even better with the sunroof curtain open at night or on a rainy day.', '', 'Three people at the back should also be no problem given that the floor is flat and the cabin is wide enough. Other features you get are a reclinable backrest, AC vents, a boss mode lever to push the co-passenger seat forward, a phone holder, a Type-C USB charger, armrest with cupholders and large door pockets. The only things which could have made this experience better but are missing are window shades and ambient lights. Overall, this is a second row that will surely keep you happy and comfortable over longer journeys.', 'Third row', '', ""If you want a 7-seater SUV, then you will have to pick the top few variants as the base will only get the 5-seater option. The exact details as to which variant gets what seating layout will be revealed closer to the launch. To access the third row you will have to tumble and fold the second-row single seat by pulling a lever. Once in, the space for an adult is a bit tight. However, there is still a bit of knee room left for someone of my height (5 foot 7 inches) when the second row is not reclined. What you can't do here is push the second row forward as it does not slide to open more room. To get more comfortable, you will have to recline the third row. Once done, the seating position is comfortable for even an adult to spend a couple of hours in, and children will definitely not mind spending time in the seat. In terms of features you get two cupholders, your own personal AC vents with blower controls, grab handles and even speakers in the third row. Even the overall visibility is quite good with a large glass area to look out of."", 'Boot space', '', 'While Mahindra has not given us official numbers, the space behind the third row is only good for small laptop bags or duffle bags. And if this third row is reclined all the way back you will not be able to fit an overnight suitcase there. What you can do is is fold the third row to open up a nice and large flat boot floor which will accommodate all of your large suitcases and bags for the entire family for the weekend trip. If you still want more space then you can fold even the second row flat, which will open up space for oversized items like a washing machine or table. And if you plan on going for an adventure, a mattress will fit just fine in there.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210818_091657/732/mahindra0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

With the facelift, you can positively expect some heads to turn. This is the first product to debut Tata’s newer design language, glimpses of which we first saw in the Curvv concept. It seems like the Nexon is now puffing its cheeks at you with the added muscle in the front bumper.', '', 'The vertical elements in the bumper add to the sense of height. The LED projector headlights are positioned lower now, and the cube-shaped fog lamps complete the lighting block on the bumper. There’s a functional vent here, designed to route air through.', '', 'However, it’s the new lighting signature that’s going to grab your attention first. There’s a slick animation on unlock, and the smooth white lighting adds a touch of class. You get dynamic (swipe-style) turn indicators too, elevating your sense of the Nexon’s worth as a product. You’re unlikely to dismiss it as an ‘affordable’ or ‘entry level’ SUV.', '', 'The doors and the roof remain identical; therefore the side profile is possibly the only angle where you can draw an immediate parallel to its earlier versions. There’s a new set of 16-inch alloy wheels here, which won’t look out of place on an EV. Tata Motors has opted for plastic aero flaps within the diamond-cut design, which they claim is better for aerodynamic efficiency. It also enables them to offer customisation at a later stage.', '', 'Chances of you going ‘Oh wow’ are highest at the rear, though, mostly due to the new lighting signature. The tail lamps do a little dance on lock/unlock, which lends a sense of occasion. Another design detail — Tata has hidden the wiper away under the chunkier spoiler now, which means lower variants without a spoiler won’t immediately appear barebones.', '', 'Do note that Tata Motors has gone to town garnishing the Nexon with gloss black trim elements. The surround for the daytime running lamps, the swoosh under the window line and even the tail lamps have a glossy black texture. Please be careful to clean these areas with care (and not in circular motion), as they get scratched quite easily. Alternatively, investing in a paint protection film (PPF) might be a wise decision.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64f83cec169b8.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'Changes to the exterior are drastic, but the interiors manage to top it. The Nexon has levelled up on three crucial counts: design, quality, and tech. Let’s run through them one by one.', '', 'With a whole lot of horizontal lines, slim AC vents and a free-floating touchscreen, there are German car-like details in the Nexon’s cabin. Minimalism has clearly been the core mantra here, as Tata seems to have gone to town eliminating physical buttons almost entirely.', '', 'There’s a new two-spoke steering wheel that debuts with the Nexon. Flat-bottomed and meaty, the steering wheel exudes class as well. Add the backlit logo and the capacitive buttons in the mix (that thankfully still have physical feedback) and you’ve got a steering that’s memorable in equal parts from a design and functionality standpoint.', '', 'However, you can’t say the same for all of the cabin. There are clear instances of form preceding function. For instance, the USB chargers are hard to access, and the cupholders are tucked away inside the glovebox. The design also means there’s very little margin for error in terms of fit and finish, and that’s where Tata struggles a little. A few ill-fitting panels and misaligned trims were observed on both our test cars. These issues have existed since the Nexon debuted, and it seems they’d go away only when we see an entirely new generation.', 'Design apart, the uptick in quality is immediately apparent too. Go hunting in the lower half of the dash, and you’d be pleasantly surprised with a cross-hatch texture we’ve seen in the Altroz. The dashboard — split into three sections — all deliver a little more in terms of the feel-good factor.', '', 'A carbon fibre-like texture in the mid-pad and a wrapped leatherette lower section ups the ambiance of the cabin. The same leatherette spills over onto the door pads, and the soft leatherette upholstery also seems slightly smoother and cushier than before.', 'Tata has been bold with the use of purple on the dashboard and the seats. Thankfully, that’s limited to just the purple exterior colour. All the other colours get an all-black interior which is a whole lot more likeable to those with simpler tastes.', 'Ingress-egress continues to remain fuss-free, there’s no change here. We noticed a slight dip in the rear seat kneeroom, which we can attribute to three reasons: thicker cushioning on the front seat, the lack of a seat-back scoop, and the added cushioning on the rear seat base which betters underthigh support, but pushes your knees ever so slightly forward. We don’t expect a change in space in variants that don’t get the extra comfy leatherette seats.', '', 'There’s enough space for a six-footer to be comfortable behind another. No real issues with headroom or foot room either. Squeezing three in should be possible if absolutely necessary, but the Nexon is best used by a family of four and a child. There’s a proper seat belt for the central occupant, but no central headrest.', '', 'Here’s a bold claim to start this section with. The Nexon offers the BEST infotainment experience in this segment. We will add a caveat here, though. This setup needs to function reliably and glitch-free for us to stand by it. Between the twin 10.25-inch displays the experience is phenomenal. Crisp display, classy fonts, quick response time, and a genuinely intuitive user interface all make the system a joy to interact with.', '', 'We’ve experienced the touchscreen in the Harrier/Safari earlier, but Tata has refined it further in terms of software. It did hang once on our drive, and we needed a rather elaborate reset process to get it working again. We’re assured these final chinks in the software are already being ironed out.', '', 'The 10.25-inch instrument cluster brings a few preset views along with the usual gamut of information you’d want. A cool party trick is its full-screen navigation view. You can relay Google Maps from Android Auto and Apple Maps from Apple CarPlay currently. Google Maps on Apple CarPlay isn’t supported currently due to some licensing limitations, but that’s one software update away.', 'Also new is a 9-speaker JBL sound system which includes a subwoofer. The bass should hit a little more this time round, and audio quality is expectedly top-shelf. Not that the Nexon suffered from a poor audio system to begin with, but this update betters it.', '', 'Another highlight is the new 360° camera. You get to choose between 3D and 2D views, both of which are executed rather well. The cameras on the mirrors activate while indicating too, giving you a feed on the touchscreen. This is convenient for sure, but it does override everything else meaning you won’t be able to see navigation here if you’re indicating.', 'Other feature highlights are carried over unchanged — front seat ventilation, cruise control, automatic headlights, wireless charging, sunroof — all make their way to the facelift. There’s no real missing feature here. In fact, with this feature set, the Nexon is going to make SUVs in a segment above feel a little hot under the collar.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64f83e670960a.jpg'}",5 Star,,,,,,,,,

Well begun is half done, they say. In the Fronx’ case this holds true. Other than the front door and the mirrors that seem like a lift from the Baleno, it shares practically no other body panel with the hatch.', 'The face looks like a scaled-down version of the Grand Vitara with the triple elements in the daytime running lamps and full-LED headlamps placed on the bumper. Do note that lower variants skip on the DRLs and you get a basic projector headlamp instead.', '', 'A wide grille and an upright nose means the Fronx stands confidently. Flared fenders with taut lines lend some muscle to the sides, and the machine-finished 16-inch wheels round things off nicely. The chunky 195/60-section tyres are standard across the range, but lower Delta+ and Zeta versions get silver alloys.', 'Maruti Suzuki has been a little adventurous with the design here, opting for a roofline that slopes sharply, paired with a raised rump. I quite like how the Fronx looks from the sides and the rear three-fourths. Details like the roof rails and the prominent skid plate stand out here.', '', 'Our test car was finished in NEXA’s staple deep blue, and we got to see a deep red Fronx too. With the red, silver and brown shade you can choose to have the roof and ORVMs finished in bluish-black paint in the top-spec Alpha variant.', 'On first impressions, the Fronx looks more like a scaled-down SUV than an outright cross hatch.

The interior is a copy-paste from the Baleno which means it’s going to be thoroughly practical and usable, and at the same time have absolutely no novelty. Maruti Suzuki has tried to give the Fronx its own identity with some maroon accents instead of the Baleno’s blue, but that feels like too little too late.', '', 'The only tangible difference is in the seating position since the Fronx sits higher off the ground. From the driver’s seat, visibility is great and you can spot the edges of the vehicle easily. This might push you to pick the Fronx over the Baleno if it’s going to be your first car.', 'As far as quality is concerned, the Fronx feels par for the course. It’s not exceptional in any manner — there’s still quite a bit of hard plastic on the dashboard — but the fit and finish levels have gone up a few notches compared to older Marutis. Interestingly, there’s soft leatherette on the door pads and elbow rests, but the seats are draped in fabric. You could add on some leatherette seat covers as accessories, but we think this should’ve been bundled in for the price.', '', 'At the rear too, the higher seating position coupled with a low window line means the view out from the side is great. Frontal view is obstructed by the XL-sized headrests. Also, it’s here that you feel that the Fronx lacks that ‘sense’ of space and airiness despite having oodles of ‘actual’ space. Most of that is down to the black-maroon colour scheme. Space is ample for a six-footer to sit comfortably behind their own driving position. There’s no dearth of footroom either, but given the sloping roofline, headroom is compromised. In fact, over sharp bumps, those taller than six feet might have their head hit the roof. The solution, of course, is to sit further ahead on the seat with an obvious trade off in knee room.', 'Seating three abreast is possible, but will be a tight squeeze. Consider it a four-seater if your family consists of well fed adults. For the odd time you might actually seat three, the headrest and a proper three-point seatbelt — the only notable addition over the Baleno — for the middle occupant will feel helpful. You will miss a central armrest and cupholders however.', '', 'Maruti has focussed on nothing more than the essentials for the Fronx. There are a few highlights including a heads-up display, a 360° camera and a wireless charger. The rest, including cruise control, an auto-dimming IRVM, a nine-inch touchscreen, climate control and rear AC vents are standard fare for the segment. There’s wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay too.', 'Hyundai-Kia have spoilt us silly here. With the Venue/Sonet offering features such as front seat ventilation, powered driver’s seat and a branded Bose sound system to name a few. While these misses are unlikely to raise an eyebrow, the absence of a sunroof most certainly will.', '', 'Comb through the feature distribution and you find Maruti aiming to provide utility across the range. Crucial bits such as a rear defogger, 60:40 split seats, adjustable headrests, four power windows and climate control are offered as standard. The Delta variant (one above base) adds more usability in the form of powered ORVMs, steering-mounted audio controls along with a seven-inch touchscreen.', 'While the Fronx leaves a little more to your wants, it ensures your needs are amply catered to.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6432396c4c830.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

Now, you additionally get a large digital instrument cluster, automatic rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, Type C charging ports, electronic parking brake, integrated controls for the air purifier, cruise control with speed limiter, all power windows auto up/down and illuminated. Apart from this, you also get a crowd favourite: panoramic sunroof.', '', ""Apart from this, power driver seat, seat ventilation, auto headlamps, Bose's 8-speaker sound system, sound mood lighting, 360-degree cameras, wireless charger, and the reach and tilt of the steering wheel is still the same as it used to be."", '', ""What's missing? Well, there are a lot of buttons in the dual-zone climate control so it looks a bit dated, despite improving functionality. Then, the infotainment doesn't get wireless Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, and finally, the passenger seat doesn't get height adjustment. That's it."", '', 'This aspect is also sorted. You can easily store a 1-litre bottle in all the door pockets along with other items like a cleaning cloth. In the middle, you get a dedicated phone charging tray with cooling, and another big open storage in the centre console to store knick-knacks. However, the latter does not get a rubber mat and hence things do rattle around a bit.', 'After this, you get two cup holders in the centre. You can remove the partition and make it a big storage and even close the new tambor door to keep a phone on top. A deep pocket is also given to keep the keys on the side. The sunglass holder gets a nice soft padding and the storage under the armrest is also plenty. And finally, while the glovebox is of a good size, it lacks cooling.', '', 'While the Seltos is pushing the boundaries in all other departments, the rear seat experience remains mediocre. Yes, there is no shortage of space here and you can sit comfortably with your legs stretched. Knee and shoulder room is also plenty but the headroom is a bit compromised thanks to the panoramic sunroof. And the comfort could have been better. The seat base is a bit short, which leaves you wanting more under-thigh support. And while the backrest has two reclining settings, better contouring would have helped with support.', 'That said, the features are good though. You get privacy curtains, two Type-C ports and a phone holder, armrests with 2 cup holders, and the good thing is that the height of the armrest and the door armrest are the same so you feel more comfortable. Another good thing is that you have adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts for all 3 passengers.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64bfb99dc85f6.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

Also, there are front parking sensors, but no 360-degree camera. Other cabin features include a sunroof, 64 colour ambient lights which are nice and bright, and heated and ventilated seats."", '', 'Infotainment is impressive too with a 10.25-inch touchscreen, eight-speaker Bose sound system with a subwoofer which is good, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and physical touch controls which can also double up as climate control buttons. However, the Verna still misses out on wireless Auto and CarPlay. Overall, it is really hard to fault the Verna in the features department as not only is the list impressive, but each feature is well executed.', 'Rear Seat Space', '', ""Rear seat space was the Achilles' heel of the Verna family. It was the least spacious sedan in the segment. While it is still not the most spacious sedan in the segment, you will not be left wanting more space. There is space for six-footers to sit behind one another and the highlight here is the seat comfort. Large seats, good padding, ample under-thigh support and a relaxed backrest makes this possibly the most comfortable seat in the space. Yes, room for three at the back is still tight but if you are looking at being chauffeur driven, then this backseat is quite appealing."", '', 'What could have been better here are the features. Yes, you do have two mobile charging sockets, a rear sunshade, rear AC vents and an armrest with cupholders, but things like window shades and dedicated mobile pockets could have elevated this experience. And while all three passengers get three-point seatbelts, the middle passenger does not get a headrest.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/642403566cfcf.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

The revised grille, which is now in sync with larger Hyundai SUVs, helps it look more dominant. Plus the grille gets dark chrome which, in my opinion, looks rather tasteful. Lower down, the bumper has been made more sporty and the skid plate more prominent. What buyers will also appreciate are the new LED projector headlamps emitting white light. However, the indicators are still bulbs and look out of place on this revised face.', '', 'The side features bolder 16-inch dual tone alloy wheels and the ORVMs now fold in and out automatically when you lock/unlock the car. They get puddle lamps as well. Roof rails get a new design but it is hard to tell the difference. The Venue is being offered in 6 sober colors and only the red gets the option of a black roof.', '', 'At the back is where the Venue looks properly modern. The new LED treatment looks unique with connected strip and block lighting for the brakes. Even the bumper has been given the block treatment for reflectors and the reverse light. Overall, while this is still immediately recognizable as a Venue, the changes help it look bolder and have a much better road presence.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20220623_143402/782/oem-name0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The cabin of the Venue has seen less visual changes than the exterior. The dashboard is now finished in dual tone and the upholstery has been updated to match. However, you get part-leatherette and not full leatherette upholstery which is preferred by some buyers.', '', 'In terms of feature updates, the driver gets the most. The driver seat is now powered for recline and slide adjustment, there is a digital instrument cluster which now has a highline tyre pressure monitoring system (individual tyre pressures displayed) and turn-by-turn navigation display, and a Type-C port for device charging. The turbo-petrol-DCT powertrain also gets drive modes, which we will get to a little later.', '', 'Other feature additions include an ambient light in the dashboard storage and a centre-armrest integrated air purifier, which was earlier placed in one of the cup holders. The biggest change however has been to the infotainment system. The screen still measures 8-inches and we would have liked to see a 10-inch display, but the interface is now completely new. The display is sharper and the icons look much better. The fluidity and response of the system is also smoother than before. It gets 10 regional languages to choose from and most of the voice commands are now processed by the system itself and are not network dependent, which reduces the response time. An update in the connected car tech now allows you to ask Google or Alexa at home for tyre pressures, fuel level and more. These changes improve the experience of the infotainment quite a bit.', '', 'However, we expected more from this update. The Venue has some silly, and other major omissions in features which could have been avoided. The driver seat misses out on powered height adjustment and ventilated seats. Other smaller omissions include auto day/night IRVM, a branded sound system or tuning, rain-sensing wipers and telescopic steering wheel adjustment. These features, if present, could have really taken the Venue to the top spot again in the features department.', '', 'Hyundai has worked toward improving the rear seat experience as well. The front seat backs are now scooped out to offer better knee room and the seat base is tweaked to offer better underthigh support, and these have worked. The seat also features a 2 step backrest recline which adds a layer of personalised comfort for the occupants.', '', 'Another welcome addition are the 2 Type-C charging ports under the AC vents.

The headlamps are all LED units and the DRLs are very detailed and look great at night."", '', 'The fog lamps vary with different variants and you have four different wheel options with two alloy wheel designs. There is a new spoiler at the back and the LED connected tail lamps look great. So, overall, this Sonet looks better than the previous one. Mission accomplished.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/659f71ff033f3.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The key of the Sonet has also changed. Earlier, this key was seen in the EV6, then in the Seltos and now in the Sonet. Here you get lock, unlock, remote engine start and boot release options. And this key is definitely more premium than the old one.', '', ""Highlight of the interior is its fit, finish and quality. All the elements you see here are very solid and don't move. They don't feel loose and that's why when the car ages they won't rattle. The plastics have a very smooth finish and the quality of the steering leather wrap, seat upholstery and the armrest leather wrap all feel plush. Really, sitting in this cabin you get the premium and expensive feel. However, the layout feels a little odd to me especially because of this big cladding in the front and this centre console. It would have been better if it was a little more minimalistic. In this update Kia has improved the buttons of the centre console; however, the same treatment should have been given to the entire dashboard -- similar to the one which the Seltos got."", ""Kia Sonet has always been at the top in terms of features. But due to the rise in competition, this crown was snatched from it. However, with the added features, it's once again the most feature-loaded SUV in the segment."", '', 'Talking about additional features, now it gets an all-digital instrument cluster with an amazing display. It was also seen in the Seltos and here its layout, display and graphics are quite good. Plus, now that it has a 360-degree camera, you also get the convenience of blind spot monitors. So while driving, the safety and convenience increases a bit more.', ""Furthermore, the 360-degree camera’s quality and the final stitched image is very clear so it becomes easier to use. Plus, the feed of this camera is also available on your mobile. So, suppose the car is parked somewhere far away and you are scared that it is not safe, then you can directly check the car's surroundings from the phone itself, which is a very neat feature."", '', ""To increase the driver's convenience Kia has also added 4-way adjustable power seats for the driver which means that sliding and reclining can be done electrically. However the height adjustment is still manual. Other features include a 7-speaker Bose sound system, ambient lighting, automatic climate control, drive modes, traction modes, front ventilated seats, auto day-night IRVM, automatic climate control, sunroof and air purifier."", '', ""If we talk about the infotainment, Sonet still comes with this 10.25 inch infotainment system which is the best in the segment. The same infotainment is also available in the Venue with a different theme. The display, smoothness and sense of operation logic is very accurate. And the best part is that it does not glitch at all. It always runs smoothly. That's why the experience of using it is very good. And this comes paired with a Bose 7-speaker sound system, which is really great. There is only one problem: wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are not available in this. For that, you still have to connect a wire, and that too a USB cable, because it does not work with Type-C."", '', ""The Sonet’s cabin is also very practical for occupants. You get a lot of storage and charging options here. Let's start with the door pockets where you can easily keep a 1 litre bottle of more stuff. Apart from that, you get a large open storage in the centre which has a wireless charger with an air vent so that your phone doesn't get too hot. And behind that, of course, you get two cup holders and a phone slot. You get space inside the armrest as well but it is a little compromised due to the air purifier. The glove box is also decent sized but you don't get a cool feature here. And if we talk about the charging options then you have a Type C, wireless charger, a USB charger and a 12V socket."", '', ""For the rear seat occupants, there is good space in the Sonet. You can stretch your legs as there is space under the front seats. The knee room is adequate and the head room is also good. So people up to 6 feet won't complain here. But the comfort of the seat could have been a little better. While the backrest angle is relaxed, the contouring could have been better. But yes, these flat seats have one advantage: seating 3 adults is more accommodating. And while there is no headrest for the third passenger, there is a 3-point seat belt."", '', 'The good thing is that you get a lot of features in this seat. This armrest has 2 cup holders and the height of this, and the door armrest is the same so it feels more comfortable to use. Plus, the door armrest is also wrapped with leather so you have the premium feeling here as well. Window sunshades help in summers and you get two Type-C ports for charging as well. There is a storage area where you can keep your phone or wallet and the rear AC helps with air circulation. However, these don’t come with any blower control. There is a new seat back pocket as well for mobile and wallets.

The front bumper, which gets a revised air dam, has been tweaked to accommodate the extra big grille and also gets a skid plate like before that now houses the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) radar.', '', 'It’s from the sides that you will notice none of the changes made to the SUV. The higher-specced trims of the Hector have continued with the same 18-inch dual-tone alloy wheels but lower variants get 17-inch wheels.

The facelifted Hector also has the body side cladding with chrome inserts with the same ‘Morris Garages’ insignia.', '', 'The Hector now comes with connected LED taillights, with lighting elements in the centrepiece. Apart from that, the SUV’s ‘Internet Inside’ badge has been replaced with that of the ADAS while its tailgate sports the ‘Hector’ moniker. The chrome strip now runs the width of the SUV’s derrière and the Hector’s rear bumper has been slightly redone as well.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/63e4a91c45198.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'If you are someone who has experienced the MG SUV from close quarters, you would instantly feel at home once you step inside the facelifted model. Although the cabin has been heavily redesigned, it still features the same steering wheel (with both rake and reach adjustment) and a vertically stacked infotainment system. While the SUV may not offer as much practicality as some of its rivals, it can still instil the big sense of space as it did before.', '', 'The SUV’s interior has fortunately retained the dual-tone cabin theme, making it feel as airy and roomy as before. You will notice the reworked dashboard finished in black which sports silver and chrome accents in the AC vent units and piano black elements, giving it a rich and premium feel. MG has used soft-touch material on the upper portion of the dashboard, door pads and above the glovebox but the lower half is just made of hard plastic, a big letdown. It also has revised central AC vents to house the bigger touchscreen unit, the start/stop button is now more squarish than circular, and gets a new gear shift lever as well.', '', 'Even the centre console has been updated – now featuring a generous dollop of silver around the gear lever, cup holders and other controls – and is connected to the touchscreen unit. It leads to the front centre armrest, which is slidable and includes a storage compartment for your knick knacks.', '', 'Its seats are finished in beige and are well bolstered and supportive, offering a good seating posture. The front seats are power-adjustable while offering plenty of headroom and knee room for even six-footers. There’s a range of adjustments to the driver seat to help you find a suitable driving position and enjoy an expansive view from the windshield.', '', 'For those who like to be chauffeur-driven, the rear seats are spacious and can seat as many as three adults… as long as they’re on the leaner side. While there’s no dearth of headroom and legroom, shoulder room will become a luxury once the number crosses two. Thankfully, there’s no central transmission tunnel, so the middle passenger has healthy legroom. MG has provided the rear seats with slide and recline functionality for even more comfort, and there are adjustable headrests for all three rear occupants.', '', 'If we were to nitpick, the seat contouring should have been slightly better, especially at the sides of the rear bench, and there should have been more underthigh support. On the bright side, the SUV’s big window areas let in more air and light inside the cabin, but it can be a bummer in summers. MG has given AC vents, two cup holders, and a phone docking area with USB fast-charging port for those seated in the rear.', '', 'One of the most important highlights of the facelifted Hector is the bigger 14-inch touchscreen system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. While its display is much clearer and larger, the user interface (UI) is laggy, sometimes taking entire seconds to respond. Even its voice commands, although functional, tend to mishear your required actions. Another downside, also prevalent with many modern tech-laden cars, is the absence of physical switches to control the air conditioning and other features.', '', 'Other equipment on board the MG SUV include a massive panoramic sunroof, a digital driver’s display, eight-colour ambient lighting, and ventilated front seats. There’s also an eight-speaker Infinity sound system with subwoofer and amplifier, wireless phone charger, rain-sensing wipers, and over 75 connected car features.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/63e4a9b3aac66.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

The 2022 Tiago also comes with projector headlights and LED DRLs, the latter placed near the fog lamps. There is also a new Midnight Plum shade on the compact hatchback which helps fill the void of a Dark Edition Tiago.', '', ""In profile, the only two new changes you will spot are the chrome garnish on the door handles and new 14-inch stylised wheel covers which make the steel wheels look like they are dual-tone alloys.

Until now, the Tiago was only offered with a black and grey dashboard layout. However, with the recent update, Tata has tried to freshen things up a bit as the top-spec XZ+ trim now gets a dual-tone black and beige cabin setup. A new seat upholstery sums up the changes on the inside.', '', 'The build quality and fit-finish of the interior is impressive as well. The seats are also well padded and have proper contouring to hold you in comfort for longer journeys. Also, while the driver gets a height adjustable seat, the passenger’s seat feels a bit tall and is not adjustable for height. Taller passengers will feel like sitting over the car and not in it.', '', 'At the rear, the bench too feels well cushioned and contoured. While it is suitable for two people, seating three would not be a big problem for city stints. However, the rear headrests are non-adjustable, which hampers adequate neck support. If Tata would have added an armrest or a mobile charging port here, the experience could have been a lot better.', '', 'If cabin practicality is considered, the Tiago gets two cup holders near the handbrake, a cooled glovebox, a space to store your phone and a cubby hole on the driver’s side of the dashboard. It also has map pockets and bottle holders on all four doors. However, the map pockets are slim and aren’t suitable for anything other than paper and cloth.', 'Features and Technology', '', 'The Tiago comes with a decent feature list including a 7-inch touchscreen system which works well, Android and Auto/Apple CarPlay connectivity, and is paired with an 8 speaker (4 speakers, 4 tweeters) setup which sounds very good. If you are someone who prefers using voice commands, Tata has taken care of that as well in the Tiago.

But there are a few key differences. Firstly, overall length has been shortened by chopping the boot area (after the C-Pillar) to shorten the length by 200mm, from 4195 to 3995mm. As a result, when viewed from the side, the XUV300 looks a bit strange as the design ends quite abruptly.', '', 'Also, the Tivoli’s ground clearance of 167mm is lower than the XUV300. Even though it has been raised for India, the XUV300 sits lower than the competition. However, it boasts of a segment-leading wheelbase, which along with the 215/60 R17 tyres on our top-end W8 (O) test car, give it a confident look.', '', 'In terms of design, the XUV300 looks similar to the Tivoli, but Mahindra state that every panel is different from the Tivoli. You can see that the face is more aggressive despite being neater. The slim grille gets the chrome slot treatment just like the XUV500. It wedges in neatly between the angular headlamps that flare out as they head towards the side. The sharp LED DRLS give this SUV quite a distinctive look.', '', 'From the side, the XUV300 reminds us of the Hyundai Creta, which is no bad thing. The A-Pillar, roofline and roof rails (not offered in the UK) contribute to that effect. But, if it stood a bit taller, the SUV look would have been cemented solid. When it comes to premiumness, the diamond-cut alloys play their part just right.', '', 'From the rear, the XUV looks quite rugged and premium, thanks to the wide hips and high-set tail lamps which use smooth LED elements. Just to be clear, the look here is completely different from the Tivoli, and better for it.\xa0Also, while the manual transmission-equipped XUV300 gets model and variant badging at the rear, the XUV300 AMT adds the “autoSHIFT” badge, making the automatic XUV300 easier to identify.', ''], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20190206_114259/600/mahindra0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The XUV300 might be the baby of its family, but on the inside it feels more premium than its elder sibling, the XUV500. The two-tone colour combination for the cabin looks very inviting. The leatherette seats also use the lighter colour, giving a sense of being in a car from a segment above. These seats also use firmer cushions for the side bolstering for greater support in corners. The only hiccup is that the light colour means they will get dirty quickly.', '', 'Smart looking touches include\xa0the steering wheel, embellished with gunmetal grey switchgear. The simple instrument cluster is easy to read and the controls for display sit in between them. However, bits like the central unlock switches, the flimsy feel of the stalks on the steering wheel and the door release lever feel cheap and tacky. The centre console could have also looked better. In a world of floating screens and minimal buttons, this looks a bit out of place on a new car.', '', 'Additionally, while the manual gear lever blends well with the rest of the interior, the AMT gear selector looks a bit out of place. The Vitara Brezza’s AMT gear selector, for example, looks more premium and purpose-built to match the rest of the cabin.', '', 'The driver gets a height adjustable seat and a tilt adjustable steering to find the right seating position too. But, the footwells are too cramped to accomodate a dead pedal. This will add a bit of stress to your left leg in long drives. However, whether tall or short, you will have enough room in the front and the view of the road ahead is confidence inspiring, spotting the edge of the hood is easy.', '', 'The second row treats its occupants acceptably. The seat cushioning is supportive and there is enough knee room and headroom to accommodate six-footers. Even sitting three abreast is managed with reasonable comfort as the middle passenger doesn’t sit shoulder to shoulder with the other occupants as the seat pushes him forward slightly. However, the low-set seat feels short on under-thigh support and the smaller window area eats into the sense of space. However, for a car that boasts of class-leading wheelbase and width, we were expecting a greater sense of space and comfort in the backseat. Also, the lack of any charging options feels a bit strange.', '', 'In the transition from Tivoli to XUV, the boot space has really suffered. Chopping 200mm of overall length has resulted in a luggage carrying capacity that is more like a mid-size hatch. The 60:40 split folding seats offer some flexibility, but we expect luggage space to be significantly smaller than the competition.', ''], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/carNewsEditorImages/816x544/20190203_102016/23143/mahindra0.jpg'}",5 Star,,,,,,,,,

A balance of keeping the silhouette conventional to please the conservatives, while dialling in radical and detailed elements to keep the design nerds happy. The first thing you will notice is the raised headlamps and grille, which form a new layer over the bumpers. Surrounded in black, this makes the muscular bonnet appear to be floating on the body.', '', 'And then comes the flared muscular wheel arches, which won’t look out of place on an SUV. From the side, you notice the contrast black in the window line, ORVM and the roof. The wheels are 195/55 R16 for the petrol and 185/60 R16 for the diesel, both stylish dual-tone alloys. The design looks even cleaner with the rear door handles tucked away next to the window.', '', 'At the back, the theme of the sharp creases continues with the taillamps forming another plane over the bumpers. And because this entire panel is blacked out, the taillamp cluster isn’t visible and the lights seems to be floating in the body at night. Well done.', '', 'But the devil is in the details. The black panels on the outside of the car are finished in piano black, which is notorious for getting scratched. In our conditions, it will require a lot of effort to look fresh. You have to pull the further side of the rear door handles to open it, which takes effort to get used to. The headlamps are just projector units, not LEDs. Even the DRLs are not very detailed. The taillamps too miss LED elements. Despite these misses, the Altroz is the widest car in the segment and possibly has the best stance. We can only imagine how modern the car would have looked without these misses. If you are looking for road presence from your hatch, look no further.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/expert-review/tata-altroz/20191209_104759/large/Red-Altroz-resized20191209_104759.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['The Tata Altroz has a trick up its sleeve before you even get inside. The doors, both front and rear, open a full 90 degrees for easy ingress and egress. This ability has been dialled in the Alpha Arc platform and will continue to future products as well. Sit in the car, close the door and it shuts with a solid thud.', '', 'The steering is possibly the most impressive bit of the interiors. It has a flat bottom and comes wrapped in premium leather. The mounted buttons for the audio, infotainment, calls, instrument cluster and the cruise control sit over the horn actuation. The instrument cluster too is a fancy 7-inch display with a lot of details like music, navigation directions, drive mode and even gets various colour themes.', '', 'The dashboard has also been designed in various layers. The grey portion holding the centre console is a bit elevated and hides ambient lighting under it. Below it is a silver satin finish which feels premium and at the bottom you have grey plastic which are less nice. And along with the light and dark grey fabric upholstery on the seats, the overall experience of the cabin is quite airy.', '', 'The touchscreen is a 7-inch unit with a layout similar to that of the Nexon. Luckily, it isn’t laggy and works smoothly even with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It also displays the climate control settings in one corner, and gets physical buttons to make operating it while driving more ergonomic. A neat trick here is that you can give voice commands to change climate settings. In other features, you get a height adjustable driver’s seat, automatic headlamp, rain-sensing wipers, rear wiper and washer, 6 speakers, power windows with auto-down on driver side and engine push button start stop.', '', 'The cabin is high on practicality too. You gets tonnes of storage like an umbrella and bottle holders in the doors, two cup holders, centre storage space, front sliding armrest with storage and a big 15-litre cooled glove box.', 'Rear Seats', '', 'The overall width of the Altroz translates to a wide rear cabin space here as well. This does make seating three abreast easier. And if you are seating only two at the back, they can enjoy the convenience of a centre armrest. Other features on offer are rear AC vents and a 12V accessory socket. But the plastic quality on the AC vent controls leaves a bit to be desired and the rear should have had a USB port instead.', '', 'In terms of space, you get a decent amount of legroom as you can tuck your feet under the driver’s seat. Knee room is ample too, but the headroom might become an issue for taller occupants. The underthigh support does feel a bit lacking but the cushioning is soft and will make for a comfortable long distance drive. Overall visibility remains good as well, even with the sharply raked windows.', 'Safety', 'In terms of safety kit, the Altroz gets dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, cornering stability control, ISOFIX child seat mounts and rear parking sensors as standard.

The Hyryder is no different; sure it has the silhouette and majority of panels similar to its Suzuki counterpart, the Grand Vitara. Let me tell you this straight, the Hyryder looks more suave and upmarket in flesh than in pictures. I was not a fan of its front fascia, but it changes your perception when you see it in person. It looks chic, especially in this ‘Speedy Blue’ dual-tone colour scheme with a glossy black upper section.', '', 'Up front, the most eye-catching thing is its twin daytime running LEDs, which also double up as indicators, separated by a chrome sash. I had my doubts about the grille’s faux carbon fibre finish, but it looks classier and neat in person. The gaping grille, which is flanked by LED projector headlamps, will remind you of the Glanza and other modern Toyotas. Since the lights are placed lower down on the bumper, it does not have fog lamps. The bumper has a dapper gun metal dual-tone finish.', '', ""The compact crossover's clean lines and elongated shape make it even more attractive along the sides. This is also the angle from where it looks pretty much identical to the Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. However, the alloys are different and Hyryder has a snazzier set of wheels in comparison."", '', 'The rear of the Hyryder looks particularly sharp and uncluttered. It has very sleek wrap-around tail lamps with C-shaped LED motif. It does not offer connected tail lamps like most modern SUVs. Toyota should have offered the same as it would have made the deal much more appealing. I feel that they must have been saving this for its facelift. The reversing and indicators are placed on the bumper just like the Grand Vitara.', 'Overall, the Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder looks chic and flamboyant with its please-all design.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6309dd809f20b.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', ""The Hyryder's cabin complements its suave exterior by offering a premium-looking modern design. Step inside the hybrid variant and you will get to see a dual-tone chocolate brown and black theme with plenty of soft-touch leatherette material on the dash. The heavy doors close with a decent thud of assurity. The front seats are nicely bolstered and look quite posh and racy. With adequate firmness on offer, they will help you keep the fatigue at bay during long drives. Space is not an issue up front, the driver’s seat and steering wheel offer enough adjustment for you to find a comfortable driving position."", '', 'Perceived quality levels are at par with the popular segment players like the Kia Seltos. That said, there are some visible downers such as the AC vents’ fit and finish as well as the thin sunroof curtain. The MG Astor continues to remain the benchmark for cabin fit and fish in this segment. However, these are not deal breakers, but certainly areas that could have been better executed.', '', 'Toyota has used the 2600mm wheelbase cleverly to carve out a healthy amount of rear seat room. Three average adults can sit with ease, while for larger body frame passengers it would be a bit of a squeeze. Though the rear seats offer reclining functionality, the headroom will still be just about enough for someone around six feet or taller. Being a Toyota, it gets three individual headrests and three-point seat belts for all rear passengers. Behind the central armrest, you get twin rear AC vents and two USB ports (both type A and type C). The cabin is filled with dark colours yet it feels airy, thanks to that large sunroof.', 'Features:', '', 'Being a co-developed product with Suzuki, the Hyryder benefits from a lot of equipment from Maruti’s latest feature pool. The highlight is Suzuki’s latest nine-inch touchscreen infotainment system that supports wireless Android Auto and Apple Carplay in the Hyryder. The slick capacitive screen might appear cluttered with plenty of information on the home screen but navigation through various menus is a breeze, as it is quite responsive.', '', 'Behind the steering wheel is a crisp seven-inch display, which is exclusive to the hybrid models. Like most virtual clusters nowadays, it offers easy-to-navigate menus and a couple of speedometer layouts. The head-up display is similar to what you get in the Brezza and the Baleno, projecting info such as instantaneous fuel efficiency and current speed. While a lot of SUVs in this price range offer a panoramic sunroof, it is impressive to see that the Hyryder offers a panoramic sunroof in which both the panes offer a massive opening.', '', 'Other notable features include a wireless phone charger, 360-degree camera, rake and reach steering adjustment, auto-dimming inside rearview mirror, passive keyless entry with push-button start and ventilated front seats. The connected car tech supports remote temperature control along with other key functions. Speaking of AC, the air conditioning in the Hyryder strong-hybrid runs on the hybrid battery. So the majority of times it keeps the cabin chilled even without the need for the car or engine to run. Compared to the competition, the Hyryder misses out on features like a powered driver seat and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6309debbc9dc0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

Fit and finish too are consistent inside the cabin.', 'The floor of the car is higher compared to the petrol-powered version.

Interestingly, the Magnite isn’t as wide as most of its direct rivals, nor is it as tall. Perhaps, it is this stance that makes it look longer than it is.', 'FYI - The Nissan Magnite is based on a modified version of the CMF-A+ platform that also underpins the Renault Triber. Renault will offer its own counterpart to the Magnite as well - the Kiger', 'The SUV look is on point though, with 205mm of ground clearance (unladen), 16-inch wheels as standard (alloys in the XV/XV Premium only) and functional roof rails (load capacity = 50kg) also provided directly from the base variant.', '', 'Viewed head on, the Magnite does have similarities with the Nissan Kicks, thanks to the sweptback headlamps and black contrast lower lip that houses the fog lights. But then the grille design is notably Datsun derived, since that’s the badge the Magnite was to carry originally. What’s cool is that Nissan hasn’t strayed too far from the concept car and what you’ll see in the showroom is just as distinctive.', 'The LED headlights (single projector on each side for both low & high beam with multi-reflector pilot lights) bump up the premium factor and are complemented by LED fog lamps, and LED turn indicators that have been neatly integrated above the headlights. It even gets XUV300 style LED DRLs that form long slits in the front bumper.', 'FYI - LED headlights are exclusively offered with the top end XV Premium.

The hexagonal AC vents add a sporty touch to the dashboard, with silver and chrome highlights applied to them right from the base variant.', 'Even the finish quality of the plastics is smooth and the grey fabric on the door pads is a thoughtful touch. However, the plastics don’t feel as robust or thick as they do in a Sonet, Venue, XUV300 or even EcoSport. Even the fitment quality is of a budget grade, with bits like the centre console flexing/moving about when you fiddle with it.

Overall, the Astor’s dimensions give it road presence and the subtle design gives it class, just like an urban SUV should have.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210930_114426/740/mg0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The Astor not only looks good but feels well built too. The door shutting sound and all the body panels feel robust. In fact, it is pushing the envelope for in-cabin materials and feel for all the compact SUVs in the segment. The major highlight, though, is in the feeling the cabin itself lends you. The dashboard is wrapped in padded soft leatherette which matches the upholstery. The same material also covers the centre and the door pad armrest. Even the top portion of the dashboard is soft-touch plastic. All of this feels premium to the touch.', '', 'Upholstery options in the various variants include the red + black you see in the pictures, ivory + black, and an all-black layout. And then comes the steering wheel which feels upmarket and all the controls, be it for the windows, infotainment or steering mounted, have a positive tactile feel to them. After all, there is Volkswagen DNA in them (they have the same parts supplier). The well-contoured seats feel supportive if your frame isn’t too large. The seats get 6-way power adjustment but the steering column can only be adjusted for height.', '', 'There are certain places where MG has been a little shy in quality - like the glovebox and grab handles do not soft close; the centre armrest lock feels flimsy; and the door pads, apart from the leatherette, feels hard. But these elements are cleverly placed and won’t hamper the cabin experience in daily drives. The dashboard layout feels clean and the 10.1-inch touchscreen sits in the middle, easy to reach from the driver’s seat. Also clear to read is the 7-inch digital instrument cluster with the speed and tachometer on either side.', '', 'Other features in the cabin are Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, automatic climate control, auto headlamp and wipers, push-button start/stop, panoramic sunroof, electric parking brake, 360° camera whose quality could be better and heated ORVMs. However, to balance cost, MG has omitted a few features that you now see commonly in such SUVs as a wireless phone charger, ventilated seats, paddle shifters, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, heads up display and drive modes. The music system too could have been better if not a branded one. Especially given that the segment is offering some very good sounding stereos.', '', 'The rear seats also felt supportive and there is plenty of leg, knee and headroom for even taller occupants. However, it might not be the best in the segment, especially in terms of width and under-thigh support. Seating three here will be a squeeze. In terms of features, you get adjustable headrests, AC vents, two USB chargers, armrest and cupholders. However, the addition of sunshades for windows would have made it even better.', 'Digital key', '', 'If you, like me, are challenged by memory, then the Astor has a cure for you. Say you forget the key at home and have reached the car in the basement parking. With the Astor’s digital key, you can connect the car with your phone via Bluetooth and unlock it. A connected car system depends on a network to get this done and hence Bluetooth makes it more effective. And the best part, you can switch on the car and drive it as well!', 'AI Assistant', '', 'But the above mentioned aren’t the highlights which take centre stage. That is reserved for the AI assistant on the dashboard. It’s got a head on top of a plastic body that has animation. It blinks, thinks, communicates and compliments, all with cute emoticons. In fact, it even turns and looks at you when you call it, almost making eye contact, to further enhance the human-ness of the interaction. It can even rotate and look at the passenger if it recognises that the wake-up command is coming from the passenger side. All of this is really cute and entertaining, and the kids in the family will love it.', '', 'Now let’s talk about functionality. This assistant, like most others we have seen, responds to Hinglish voice commands. It can control car functions like the sunroof, driver side window, climate control, calls, navigation and media. It can also look up answers to generic questions online much like Alexa or Google assistant. And also, it can tell jokes and greet you at festivals.', '', 'Out of all of these, the ones that you might see yourself using are calls and maybe climate control. Others are just pure novelty and will wear off with time. As far as response time is concerned, the in-car functions happen quickly but the internet-based features depend on your internet connectivity. The assistant also, at times, won’t look at you when you call it. And while the head-turning is cute, it makes a simple act more complicated and later starts to feel unnecessary, especially when it doesn’t happen. Overall, the experience of using the Assistant will be fun and one that kids will enjoy the most. But you can eventually outgrow it.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210930_114521/740/mg0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

The front particularly looks attractive thanks to the slim signature VW grille and the sleek LED headlamps. Another nice touch is the fact that the lower grille is finished in gloss black which looks very premium.', '', ""From the back, the Virtus looks like the Jetta, but here too VW has added some touches to help it look sporty. The smoked LED tail lamps look purposeful and the lower half of the rear bumper is finished in matt black to reduce visual bulk. The thick chrome strip however might not be to everyone's liking."", 'The silhouette of the Virtus looks almost identical to that of the Skoda which is no bad thing.

The rear seat too is heavily contoured, giving you great support and the overall ambience in the Virtus is nice and airy. Even four six-footers will feel comfortable with more than enough knee and just about enough headroom.

Yes, it still tucks under 4-metres in length, but at first glance it doesn’t look like a ‘small car’ in any manner. This is mostly due to its width, which at 1739mm (without mirrors) is wider than the Maruti Swift, Hyundai Elite i20 and even the Honda Jazz! At 1643mm (without roofrails), it’s taller than the likes of the Swift and the Baleno. Interestingly, the WagonR is taller!', 'The clean, fuss-free design makes it all the more likeable. Not to say there aren’t quirky elements though. For instance, the kink in the window line at the C-pillar and the smooth bulge on the roof give the Triber a unique personality. It’s interesting to see how Renault has managed to mix in some rugged elements as well. All the SUV traits we like, including a raised ground clearance (182mm), tough-looking faux skidplates and side-cladding has been thrown in. There’s a set of functional roof rails as well, that Renault claims can take up to 50kg of weight.', 'With the trademark Renault grille and the lozenge up front, it’s hard to mistake the Triber for anything else. The sleek headlamps get a projector setup for the low beam, but there are no LEDs here. Where you will find LEDs, however, are in the daytime running lamps placed on the bumper. Weirdly enough, Renault has decided to skip fog lamps altogether. This, we believe is in the interest of keeping costs in check.', 'And following that same philosophy are the wheels. At first glance they look like alloys, but they’re steel-pressed rims with wheel covers. Unlike the Kwid, the Triber gets four lug nuts for the wheels. What it borrows from its younger sibling are little details, such as the indicator on the fender cladding and trim-badging on the door.', 'Over to the rear, Renault has chosen to keep the design clean. Large tail lamps and big T R I B E R embossing on the hatch grab attention. There are no LED elements here, and there’s no rear fog lamp either. Thankfully, basics like a rear wiper and defogger are on offer.', 'So, Renault’s Triber might not be acing the design game. But it definitely has presence, and in a loud colour like orange or blue, it does manage to garner quite a few eyeballs. Renault’s also offering quite a few chrome embellishments for you to spruce up your Triber, alongside aesthetic and functional upgrades like alloy wheels and a roof carrier.']}","{'Interior': ['Getting in and out of the Triber is an easy affair. It’s a cabin you can simply walk into, and this is something elders in the family will definitely approve of. Once in, you’re greeted by a cabin that’s finished in a beige-black dual tone, with a few silver elements thrown in for good measure. There’s no wow factor in the way the dashboard is designed. It’s straightforward and strictly functional. That said, quality levels are a clear step up from what we’ve seen on the Kwid.', 'The front seats have soft cushioning and should be a relaxing place to be in. However, we wish Renault would’ve offered adjustable front headrests. On a related note, the driver’s seat could also do with a height-adjust feature.', 'Thankfully, the steering wheel gets tilt-adjust that lets you tailor your driving position better. However, you don’t get any sort of cover on the steering wheel, which makes it feel budget-grade to hold. Same can be said about the switches for the power windows and the stalks for the headlamps and wipers.', 'The Triber scores in spades in the practicality department. Dual gloveboxes on the dashboard, a deep central glovebox (that’s cooled, no less), a shelf under the air-con controls and ample space in the door pockets ensures there’s more than enough space for our knick-knacks.', 'But the bigger question is — does the Triber deliver on the promise of being a seven-seater? Yes, it does. But just about. Knee-room in the second row is just about enough for a near six-footer like me to sit behind my own driving position. To make the experience better, the second row slides by 170mm and also has a recline function. Yes, it could do with a little more width inside the cabin as the thick doorpads rob some vital shoulder room on either side.', 'Bumping up the practicality quotient is the 60:40 split for the middle row. For easier access to the third row, the split seat on the passenger’s side also gets a one-touch tumble function. Notably, the other portion of the seat merely slides forward.', 'Getting in the third row isn’t exactly easy since the opening is quite narrow. But surprisingly, adults will manage to sit here — at least for short distances. The bulge in the roof helps carve out that extra bit of headroom for the third-row occupants. Yes, there’s an evident lack of support for the under-thigh and you end up sitting with the knees near your chest. But, it doesn’t feel uncomfortably cramped. Also, since the second-row slides, it’s possible to find a sweet spot where occupants in both rows are happy with the room.', 'The Triber’s ace is the flexibility of removing the 50:50 third-row seats altogether, should you not need them. Renault calls this EasyFix, and we timed ourselves to see how quickly we could get the third row out to test it out. It takes under two minutes if a single person goes through all the steps, which we think is super quick. With the rear seats out of the way, the Triber has a whopping 625-litres of bootspace to offer. Using it as a six-seater will get you a 320-litre boot, whereas there’s 84-litres of space with all seven seats occupied.', 'Renault is offering a smart card type key with the Triber. It’s interesting to note that once the key is within range, the car will unlock by itself — there’s no need to press a button on the key or the door. Walk out of range, and the car will automatically lock too. Handy!', 'The instrument cluster is an all-digital unit, much like the Kwid, with a 3.5-inch MID in the centre. This small screen is quite informative, including details such as distance to empty, efficiency and fuel used over the usual trip and odo details. It also gets a gear change prompter that, in theory, should help you drive more efficiently.', 'But there’s a bigger screen that demands attention. Yes, the Triber packs in a large 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system. While we like the screen for its size and clarity, the interface looks old-school and boring, and it isn’t the snappiest to respond to inputs either. There’s a parking camera on offer as well, clarity for which seemed par for the course.', 'Notably, there’s no automatic climate control on offer, even on the top-spec variant. But that’s hardly going to be a concern on your daily drives. Your fellow passengers would however appreciate the AC vents in the second and third row. The vents are mounted on the B-pillar and the roof respectively and help in cooling the rear of the cabin quickly. You can adjust the fan-speed too by using the dial placed next to the central glovebox.', 'And that’s another cool feature to have. Literally. The central glovebox gets a cooling feature, which should come in handy to keep those fizzy drinks cold. Other features include a push-button start/stop button, 12V sockets for the second and as well as the third row.', 'That said, the Triber could do with more. Features such as an auto-dimming rearview mirror, steering-mounted audio/call controls would’ve helped elevate the in-cabin experience.']}",4 Star,,,,,,,,,

The build quality and fit-finish of the interior is impressive as well, and everything including the centre console and equipment such as the front AC vents and glovebox is well-integrated. While the finish of the AC controls and touchscreen buttons works in favour of the Amaze, the steering-mounted controls could have been slightly better in quality. Having said that, they perform their duties without a sweat.', '', 'The seats get a new stitching pattern but are still as supportive as earlier. And while the front headrests are adjustable, we feel Honda should have made the rear headrests adjustable as well with this update.', '', 'Honda’s not robbed the Amaze of its practicality and convenience as the facelifted sedan continues to come with two cupholders in the centre console, an average-sized glovebox, and two cupholders in the rear armrest. It also gets two 12V power sockets and as many USB slots and a total of five bottle holders (one in each door and one in the centre console).', '', 'The facelifted sedan continues to offer 420 litres of boot space as before, which should suffice for a weekend’s worth of travel luggage. Its loading lip isn’t too high and the mouth is quite wide to ease loading/unloading.', 'Features and Technology', '', 'Even with the facelift, the equipment list of the sub-4m sedan remains largely unaltered save for the addition of multiview functionality for the reversing camera. The 2021 Amaze still comes with a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, push button start/stop, auto climate control, and keyless entry. While the touchscreen unit isn’t the best in its class, it does its job pretty well. Its only issue is with the resolution of the display and the reverse camera.', 'There are a few surprises though, and not the good kind. Paddle shifters are limited to the petrol-CVT only and cruise control is still offered only on the MT variants, which isn’t something we completely agree with. We would have loved to see Honda add a couple more features as well including a leather wrapped steering, better MID, wireless phone charger, rear AC vents, auto-dimming IRVM, and adjustable rear headrests.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210825_105523/734/honda0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

The same is also communicated from the various touchpoints like all the buttons, steering wheel, and the gear shifter.', '', 'The good news continues with the seating posture as well. The driver seats are well cushioned and wide enough to accommodate drivers of most sizes. A big range for the seat height adjustment means short and taller drivers will be comfortable and have good outward visibility.

It gets two cup holders and a not-so-wide (but deep) storage tray right ahead, which can’t fit modern-day smartphones, leaving them dangling while charging.

The details of the LED headlamps and DRLs look good too, and the fog lamps get halogen bulbs for better illumination. What helps its case further is the size. This sedan is larger than the original Octavia which launched back in 2002, and when compared to the rivals, the Slavia is the widest, tallest and gets the longest wheelbase as well.', 'From the side, the Octavia resemblance is more evident.

However, if you really wish to know what engine is under the hood, the 1.0-litre or the larger 1.5-litre, look under the rear bumper. The bigger engine gets a dual tip exhaust, while the smaller one gets a single tip. Shame, though, that Skoda did not take advantage of this and put shiny exhaust tips extending to the bumper.

There are hard plastics all round, whereas cars like the Honda City offer a bit of soft and premium touch. Also, the panels, especially the bronze strip and the AC vent housing, are made of thin, low-quality plastics and bend with minimum force. They also creek and make noises, which can be a recipe for rattling sounds coming in the cabin in the later part of the ownership. The roof liner feels flimsy and the cabin light buttons should really have been smoother in operation. Also, and this might be a nitpick, why are there no soft folding grab handles in a Rs 16 lakh car?

It is the same unit as the Taigun and is fully customizable in three layouts, giving you the freedom to have the desired information up on the screen. However, the yellow theme cannot be changed, and at least should have been different between the 1.0 and the 1.5 litre engine options.', 'As for the infotainment, the fluid 10-inch screen makes its way here with a friendly interface. It has in-built apps like Gaana and BBC news, which will require a hotspot connection to operate. The in-built maps are offline, though. Also, the wireless Android Auto bugs creep in here too with music playback issues (plays two tracks simultaneously and music starts playing on the phone’s speakers when the car’s ignition is switched off) while Wireless Apple CarPlay works as intended. This, combined with the wireless charger, makes for a very convenient everyday setup. The impressive 8-speaker sound system also comes with a punchy bass, thanks to the amplifier and the boot-mounted subwoofer.', '', 'Creature comforts and cabin practicality are well sorted with automatic climate control, ventilated seats and a sunroof. The wireless charging pad is cleverly designed to not take up the space in the storage, plus you get more storage under the sliding armrest and a driver side pocket.

The Slavia offers a good safety package as well with ESP as standard, upto 6 airbags, ISOFIX seat anchors, hill hold, Multi Collision Brakes and Tyre Pressure Warning System.', 'Rear Seats', '', 'Rear seat comfort is crucial for a sedan, as the mantle of the original boss car needs to be carried with caution. Luckily, Slavia does not disappoint. The seat base is large and well contoured, and so is the seat back. This offers good support for the entire body including the under-thigh and shoulders. The recline angle is just right, and long journeys will be comfortable in this seat. Space is generous too with good knee, leg and head room. The overall visibility is good with a large glass area, thanks to the large windows and a rear quarter glass, the light roof liner, and the sunroof.', 'The limitation, however, is for three people. The strong contouring of the seats and limited width of the cabin pushes the three occupants closer to each other so much so that the shoulders start to completely overlap. And that is not comfortable. But if you seat 2, these seats are very comfortable. And that is when you will enjoy the features as well like an armrest with cupholders, which is at the same height as the door armrest, two Type-C ports, rear reading lights (which again suffer from quality issues), rear AC vents and mobile pockets.

Sure, it isn’t the most attractive car on the block but let’s get it straight: it was never trying to flatter anyone with its looks. In fact, a few sections of buyers out there prefer it for its old-school charm, something that’s not what every new car sets out to impress with.', '', 'Maruti has chosen to stick to just the bare essentials for the Eeco, which is kind of obvious given its price proposition. This includes a pair of wipers and simple halogen headlights. That’s it, that’s all there is to its front profile, with a small-ish grille and blacked-out bumper. There’s no inclusion of chrome whatsoever and no set of fog lamps either. With the engine mounted under the front passenger seats, the bonnet seems almost as upright as it can be.', '', 'Upon moving to its sides, you notice the typical van-MPV-like look of the Eeco, thanks to the tall stance and proper three-part distinction with big window panels. Once again the Eeco’s humbleness is reflected in its black door handles, 13-inch steel wheels and key-opening fuel lid. With carmakers today choosing to offer electrically sliding rear doors on modern and more premium MPVs, manually sliding the Eeco’s rear doors feels like using the traditional elevators we have in older residential or commercial buildings (requiring somewhat the same kind of effort).', '', 'It’s pretty much a similar story at the back of the Eeco too, where simplicity has been prioritised over over-the-top styling. Its rear is dominated by the huge window, followed by the “Eeco” badge, slim, upright taillights and a chunky black bumper.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6490438906c0a.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The Eeco, ever since its introduction in 2010, has stuck to a basic dual-tone themed cabin and dashboard layout with just the essentials. Yes, it has been given a couple of updates to keep things fresh inside the cabin as well, but nothing that would feel extraordinarily revamped. The previously offered 2-spoke steering wheel and analogue instrument cluster (reminiscent of that of the older Alto) have been replaced with a new 3-spoke unit and a digitised display, similar to that on the Wagon R and S-Presso, respectively.', '', 'Even the passenger side of the dashboard now has a closed off upper compartment housing the co-driver airbag instead of the open storage area while the AC controls are now bigger, with rotary units in place of slidable controls.', '', 'Thanks to the Eeco’s tall stance and the big front windshield, the view out is commendable and won’t cause any kind of inconvenience while driving it around the city. With the engine being positioned under the front seats, they are placed higher up than usual, which helps in easily finding the apt driver position. This translates to having a larger field of view while inducing the confidence that new drivers might be in search of. That said, the seats can only be reclined, only the driver seat can slide forward and neither of the two gets any adjustment for the height.', '', 'In case you were wondering where to stow your knick knacks, there isn’t much on offer here in Maruti’s entry-level people mover. All you have is a couple of cubby holes in the lower half of the dashboard, which can fit in a decent-sized smartphone and smaller items like receipts, currency, keys, etc. There is a small bottle holder tucked away in the rear centre console, but that too is rather flimsy. Maruti has provided the MPV with a 12V socket in the centre console, which is the only charging port you get in the entire car.', '', 'We had the 5-seater Eeco with us so we couldn’t sample how the third row is for passengers. But our experience with the second row instils the confidence that it should do just fine for the extra pair of occupants. Speaking about the second row, we did have three medium-sized adults sit here without experiencing any shortage of headroom or shoulder room. Thanks to the absence of the transmission tunnel, the middle passenger has enough room to stretch their legs, though it sadly doesn’t get a headrest.', 'Unfortunately, none of the four headrests provided in the Eeco get height adjustment. While the rear passengers don’t get any sort of practical or convenience features, they do have wide windows to enjoy the outside world and kill time while on longer journeys. There’s no bottle holder or door pockets for both the front and rear occupants.', 'With snazzy technology including multiple displays becoming a sort of mandate in all new cars today, the Eeco is a sweet throwback to cars from the early 2000s and 1990s (a walk down the memory lane for myself, being an ex-Maruti 800 owner).', '', 'Speaking of the equipment on board the Eeco is like counting numbers on your fingers because that’s literally how much it gets. This includes a manual AC with heater, a simple IRVM (inside rearview mirror), cabin lamps, and sun visors. It’s worth mentioning that the Eeco’s AC unit is quite powerful, as we got to sample it in summer and it successfully passed the test. However, we feel with the Eeco’s starting price now nearly touching the Rs 5-lakh mark (ex-showroom), Maruti should have at least given it a power steering and central locking to bring it a little up to date.', 'It’s only when you think of why Maruti decided to make an Eeco in the first place that you truly understand its spartan nature. A majority of its buyers aren’t looking for hi-tech wizardry or cool screens to play with but to get their job done in what can essentially take their entire family and/or cargo along in a comfortable manner.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6490448e098dd.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

The Ignis is, in fact, shorter than the Swift in terms of length and is just as wide. It is, however, taller and has a larger wheelbase too. The biggest draw here is how unique and distinctive it looks compared to any other Maruti or anything on the road overall. There is an overall square and upright stance to the design that gives it a rugged feel.', '', 'Up front, it sports a quirky front grille that envelops the fascia like a mask. Everything from the headlamps and badge sits flush in the front grille, with the clamshell bonnet sitting tall above. Chrome strips give the Ignis some flash value, but these are offered only on the top two variants. Also, the LED headlights, a feature that cars several segments above don’t offer, are available on the top end Alpha variant.', '￼', 'The Ignis has a tall-boy stance nut gets beefy cues like flared wheel arches and a chunky C-pillar. It’s a funky retro-modern blend and while you get a stylish and spunky set of 15-inch wheels (alloys on Zeta and Alpha, steel on lower variants). The lower two variants do without the rugged looking cladding for the wheel arches and side sills too. The chunky C-pillar has three slashes on it - a throwback to the Suzuki Fronte Coupe which, incidentally, was a body-style of the Maruti 800’s forefather.', '', 'Like the front, the rear too has an angry look, but it isn’t intimidating thanks to the Ignis’ petite proportions. A plus-sized set of tail lights, along with a black insert in the rear bumper make it distinctive and practical too.', 'The Ignis will be available in 9 colour options, including 3 dual-tones. Maruti Suzuki will also offer the iCreate customization packages, so owners can personalise their Ignis to their taste.

The Ignis’ cabin features an airy, functional and minimalistic layout for the cabin.', 'The dashboard itself seems to have been styled like a clam with the upper and lower half separated by a thin slit in the middle that houses the AC vents and a little storage space. The Delta variant and above get a two tone black and white dashboard, which this looks nice and techy. But, bear in mind that white interior trims tend to get soiled quite easily.', '', 'What’s really likable is the fact that we’ve never seen a cabin like this in this class. For example, there’s isn’t any centre console as such. The Delta and Zeta grades get a 2DIN music system, while the Alpha variant gets a free-standing 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the air-con controls sit independently below. Automatic climate control is exclusive to the top-end Alpha grade, while the others get a manual HVAC system. That said, there’s plenty of storage space between the front occupants, so practicality hasn’t taken a backseat for the sake of aesthetics.', 'The steering wheel is entirely new as well and gets mounted controls for audio and telephony on the Delta and above. The instrument cluster is all-new too and features two analogue dials along with one digital MID to the right. The MID is quite detailed too and includes two trip meters, the time, ambient temperature display, instant and average fuel economy displays and more.', '', 'This is a small car, but it is quite spacious. Thanks to the tall boy design, headroom is in plenty and there is enough legroom and knee room on offer too. However, the rear bench may be a little cramped for 3 occupants.

More than that, the fog lamps, air dam and front bumper have all been given a nip and tuck to keep things fresh. Rest of the details have stayed the same as before, although you now get to pick between three new colours: Techno Metallic Green, Bright White and Galaxy Blue. We had a Galaxy Blue Compass as our test car, and we have to say, we were pretty impressed with how it looked in the flesh.

You’ll find that the white and black combo interior from before has now been replaced by an all black colour scheme. That is, at least in the top-spec Model S variant. Lower variants get dual tone colour schemes, and the colours depend on the variant you pick. The dashboard now feels a lot more premium than before, thanks to the multiple layers of synthetic leather on top. The touchscreen is now available in a floating configuration and Jeep is even offering a new steering wheel. The centre console, along with the buttons for 4x4 and climate control, are also new which keeps them in line with the new cabin. The rear continues to be the same as before, save for the change in interior colour. You still get AC vents and a 12V port for your smartphone in the rear. The overall cabin quality of the Compass has seen a sharp increase in its premiumness factor.', '', 'Features', '', 'If the interior is a big step up for the 2021 Compass, then the features list is standing right next to it. Jeep has updated the touchscreen display of the Compass. It is now a 10.1-inch setup, running their latest UConnect 5 system. The highlight of this screen is that the display quality is crystal clear and that it supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. You’ll find the incredible display quality useful when the 360 degree camera pops up on your screen while reversing. The feed from the four cameras is quite clear and sharp, be it day or night. The screen however sometimes hangs when you are trying to make a call using Android Auto. It however felt like a software issue, which can easily be resolved with an OTA update. The instrument cluster is also a 10.2-inch digital affair. It is fully customisable, and you’ll end up devoting some time to understanding it due to the plethora of menus. Jeep even gives you the option to display the speed in mph instead of kmph, just in case you end up feeling the need for some overlanding adventure.', '', 'Both the driver and front passenger can now adjust their seats at the touch of a button, with the driver-side even having the option of two memory profiles. You’ll also find wireless smartphone charging onboard, so if your phone supports that, you will never again need to carry a cable when driving around in the Compass. And you will want to spend some quality time in the Compass as not only does the cabin feel premium, but so does the sound quality from the 9-speaker system by Alpine. You get ventilated seats, and we don’t need to tell you how important those are in India’s hot and humid climate. There are however no physical buttons to operate these, and you have to dive into the touchscreen to get them going. A tad complicated if you ask us.

But this isn’t the case when you view it in person. As you’d expect from any global manufacturer, the small SUV has a family look with a large Renault logo and a chrome-studded grille that connects the daytime running lamps.', '', 'The DRLs are offered as standard, along with mirror-mounted turn indicators and LED tail lamps. It’s also appreciable that Renault is offering 16-inch tyres as standard. Interestingly, if you happen to like the Caspian Blue or the Moonlight Silver shade, these can be had with a dual-tone paint scheme (contrast black roof) right from the base variants. Other colours get a dual tone theme in the top-spec RxZ variant only. For the other colours, it’s only in the top-spec RxZ variant that a two-tone theme is offered.', '', 'In the RxZ variant, the Kiger also gets triple-LED headlamps and 16-inch machine-finished alloy wheels. The SUV quotient is amped up by a healthy 205mm of ground clearance, a faux skid plate at the rear, and functional roof rails that can hold up to 50kg. Those with an eye for detail will appreciate smaller touches such as the shark fin antenna, the dual spoiler, the neat integration of the rear washer and the parking camera tucked neatly into the Renault lozenge.', 'There are surprising omissions though. For instance, you don’t get fog lamps even in the fully loaded variants and the ‘cladding’ on the doors is just a black sticker.', 'You could look at adding the ‘SUV’ accessory pack for actual cladding along the side and to the tailgate for a more robust look. If you like bling, Renault’s got a buffet of garnishes you can play around with.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210222_094159/714/renault0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['Functional and practical. That’s how we’d describe the interior of the Kiger. Access is easy, and irrespective of where you choose to sit, you simply have to walk into the cabin.', '', 'The cabin itself will seem familiar if you’ve spent time in the Renault Triber. Finished in a mix of black and dull grey, it looks like it could do with some lighter colours to liven things up. We aren’t particularly fond of the hard and scratchy plastics either. They seem sturdy but not premium.', 'From the driver’s seat, you get to see the nose of the car from the lowest position. Great if you’re just getting used to driving. Driver’s seat-height adjust is offered in the top two trims.', 'Frontal and sideward visibility is great too, but we can’t say the same about the rear. Thanks to a tiny window and raised boot, the view out isn’t all that helpful while reversing. You’ll need to rely on the parking camera.', '', 'FYI: You might fumble finding the seat belt buckle and find the footwell to be cramped. Also, the power window switches might seem too close to your right arm.', '', 'You’d enjoy the Kiger’s spacious cabin both from the front and rear seats. There’s no dearth of width. At the rear, it’s surprisingly accommodating—a six-footer will have kneeroom to spare sitting behind another. Feet room, head room and underthigh support are sufficient too. A small hiccup comes in the form of the view out of the rear window. The high window line, small window and the black colour theme dampens the sense of space. We’ll say it again—there’s no shortage of actual space here. However, using lighter colours such as beige would’ve amplified the feeling of sitting in a spacious vehicle.', '', 'With the Kiger Renault is showcasing it’s mastery at eking out every ounce of space from a small vehicle. The Kiger’s in-cabin storage leads the class at 29.1 litres. There’s ample space for everything you’d want to carry in the two glove compartments, the shelf under the touchscreen and the bottle holders in the door. The large storage compartment under the front armrest alone accounts for nearly 7 litres of space. We’d urge you to invest in the ‘central armrest organizer’ accessory since it enables you to utilise the space properly. Without the organizer, the Kiger lacks a usable cupholder inside the cabin.', '', 'There’s an equally helpful ‘boot organizer’ accessory available too. That negates the biggest bugbear of the Kiger’s deep but narrow 405-litre boot: a high loading lip. The accessory adds a false floor (that sits in line with the seats when they’re folded) and modular compartments underneath. 60:40 split seats are available in the top two variants for added versatility.', 'Technology', 'The Kiger’s feature list isn’t a tech bonanza. Focus is clearly on features you’d use on a daily basis more than those that grab headlines. So an electric sunroof, cruise control, ventilated seats and connected car technology don’t make the cut. What it does offer (especially at the price point it does) is praise worthy.', '', 'The floating 8-inch touchscreen is available in the top two variants. However, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is offered only on the RxZ. It could do with a higher resolution screen and a snappier interface. But the screen does function satisfactorily. The 8-speaker Arkamys audio system feels adequate but not exceptional. Steering-mounted audio and call controls are available from the RxT variant onwards.', '', 'Exclusive to the RxZ variant is a 7-inch display in the instrument cluster. Graphics are sharp, transitions are smooth and the font is classy. It also changes skins and offers helpful widgets based on the drive modes. For example, the Eco mode display marks out the ideal rpm range to upshift whereas the Sport display gives you a bar graph for horsepower and torque (alongside a practically useless G meter).', '', 'Other notable features on the top-spec Kiger include a PM 2.5 cabin filter, automatic climate control, rear AC vents, and a chilled glovebox.

This not only makes the welcome/goodbye animation substantially cooler, but it also doubles up as the charge status indicator. The other obvious difference is the sharper front bumper, which features vertical elements finished in chrome.', '', 'Interestingly, Tata has done away with the blue accents that were a signature for the pre-facelift Tata Nexon.

There’s turquoise stitching on the seats and crash pad too. Sure, Indian conditions and these colours aren’t exactly a match made in heaven. But if you do manage to keep it spic-and-span, you will enjoy the plush experience it brings with it.', 'Like the ICE-powered versions, the improvement in perceived quality is the biggest highlight inside the cabin. The plastics and the leatherette padding used on the dashboard, the quality of the upholstery and the clever use of accents all lend the cabin a premium feel. What this does, in effect, is help cash the cheques the minimalist almost-German car-like dashboard design is writing. We do hope Tata pulls through in terms of fit-and-finish. Our test car had no notable issues in this regard.', '', 'From a design standpoint, there are a few differences — a larger 12.3” touchscreen, a unique colour palette for the user interface, and a redesigned floor console that features an electric parking brake.', '', 'Practicality remains more or less the same as the ICE version. If you’re picking the Long Range version we had on test, do note that the bigger battery pack pushes the floor higher. This isn’t a problem in the front seats, but robs you of underthigh support at the rear. Also, there’s a minor drop in the knee room to be had, courtesy the better cushioning on the front seat, a larger rear seat squab, and the lack of a seat back scoop.', 'Tata Motors has added a few crucial features to the Tata Nexon EV’s kitty to make it more of an all-rounder. There’s a whole lot that’s carried over from the ICE version. This includes:', 'The first big change is the new 12.3-inch touchscreen which, to put it simply, is the best a Tata car has ever seen. While we faced glitches and freezes with the smaller 10.25-inch screen in the ICE-powered Tata Nexon (and the Nexon EV Fearless variant), the larger screen threw no tantrums. Like the smaller display, this too boasts of crisp graphics, great contrast, and a user interface that is super easy to get used to.', '', 'The screen runs a Qualcomm processor, gets 64GB of onboard storage and 8GB of RAM. The OS is based on Android Automotive, which enables Tata to unlock a whole host of apps. Tata is calling this ‘Arcade.EV’ — an app store that lets you download entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Hotstar, YouTube and also games.

The result is a design that’s likely to pass muster with practically everyone in the family. An upright nose, a wide grille and high-set headlamps mean the Invicto has a face that’s confident. Full-LED headlamps get Nexa’s signature triple dot daytime running lamp setup. Compared to the Hycross, the bumper has been redesigned as well.', '', 'Viewed from the side, the sheer size of the Invicto astonishes you. It’s capable of standing its own against SUVs that prey in the same price segment. You’d raise an eyebrow at the wheel size, though. It’s running on 17 inch wheels (one size down from the Hycross’s 18 inch), which despite having a classy design seem too little given the Invicto’s slab-sided profile. Tasteful dabs of chrome find their way on the door handles and under the windows.', '', 'The upright rear end is the most MPV-like angle of the Invicto. Save for the tail lamps that get a different lighting pattern, the design remains unchanged compared to the Innova.', 'You also get fewer colour options with the Invicto — blue, white, silver and grey.', 'We’d have loved to see a little more differentiation in terms of design, much like the Grand Vitara and the Hyrder.

Getting in and out is an easy affair, and you’re greeted by a cabin that’s just finished in a different colour scheme. There are no visual changes otherwise. Maruti Suzuki has chosen an all-black theme with rose gold accents akin to what the Grand Vitara Hybrid wears. It’s classy, alright, but Maruti Suzuki could’ve chosen a contrast colour for the leatherette wrap on the dashboard and door pads. The black soft-touch material simply melds into the surrounding black plastic, and you might actually be a little surprised that it’s a different material and texture upon touching it.', '', 'Save for these inserts, the plastic quality and the fit-finish leaves you wanting for more. Plastics on the dashboard are of the hard-but-durable variety which is sure to hold up over years of use. However, better graining and material would’ve helped it appeal to you a whole lot more today. We also found some iffy gaps in the interior trim on our brand new test car — not something you expect when shelling out over Rs 30 lakh.', '', 'But, as you’d expect with a Toyota/Suzuki, ergonomics are on point. The cabin feels familiar and you’d be comfortable practically instantly if you’re upgrading from a smaller vehicle. You will also appreciate the driving position that gives you a clear view of the bonnet. All round visibility is fantastic, and it’s natural to feel confident piloting the Invicto.', '', 'Space is a clear strength. You can very very comfortably fit a six-footer in each row. This isn’t one of those MPVs where the third row is reserved for kids. Actual adults can be seated here, for reasonably long journeys too. Third row occupants get roof-mounted AC vents, cupholders and phone chargers.', 'The second row is where the magic is. Chances are you want to be chauffeur-driven in your new Invicto and it simply delivers here. The seats slide a fair bit backwards which means you can sit cross-legged with ease. There’s a (rather flimsy) fold-out tray table between the seats, sun blinds and two type-C chargers here. A fold-out tray on the seat back would’ve upped the experience.', '', 'The captain seats by themselves are quite comfortable, accommodating even large frames with ease. There’s no electric adjustment for the slide or recline function here, nor do you get the ottomans that enhance calf support. This ups the comfort significantly on long drives and something you are likely to miss if you spend time in the rear seats commuting between cities. One feature you’re likely to miss is one-touch tumble for the second row, regardless of other features. The seats just slide and recline. While there’s enough space in the cabin for you to walk past the second row, a tumbling second row would’ve made ingress and egress far easier for third row occupants.', '', 'Maruti Suzuki offers the Invicto in two variants: Zeta+ and Alpha+. The top-spec variant is based on the ZX trim on the Innova Hycross. This means there’s a whole lot of features to be had, many of which are a first for a Maruti Suzuki in India. Highlights include a panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera, front seat ventilation, a dedicated climate control zone for the second and third row occupants, and a powered tailgate.', '', 'Infotainment duties are handled by a 10.1-inch touchscreen that supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Experience is sub-par for a vehicle this expensive — the screen lacks contrast and isn’t as snappy as you’d expect. The quality of the camera feed too seems sub-par for the price. Maruti Suzuki has also chosen to skip the 9-speaker JBL audio system that the Hycross gets to keep prices in check.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64ad2418a5ad3.jpg'}",5 Star,,,,,,,,,

Move to the side and the large proportions of this vehicle start to come into play. But, it is the attention to detail that stands out. The headlamps get intricate DRLS and a full matrix LED setup for lighting. The upper DRL also acts as a sequential turn indicator.', '', 'The EV6 measures 4695mm long, 1890mm wide, 1550mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2900mm. Thus, the EV6 is longer and almost as wide as the Tata Safari, while it has a lengthier wheelbase than the Toyota Fortuner!', '', 'This is because the EV’s wheels are pushed to the corners - courtesy of the EV platform. And with such size, the EV looks even sportier due to the fastback design. And then come design details like the 19-inch wheels, aero-specific ORVMs, and the flush-fitting door handles that make this car look clean.', '', 'At the back, the sharpness in design returns with the beautifully detailed connected tail lamp and the 3D pattern on the turn indicators. The spoiler too is properly sporty and what you just can’t miss once you have seen them are the reverse lights that take inspiration from a certain hypercar.', '', 'Overall, the Kia EV6 is a proper head-turner.

It has an interesting pattern on the top which is unlike any other car we have seen. The minimal layout, with just the two curved screens, helps it look really clean. The 2-spoke steering also helps solidify this minimalistic design.', '', 'Being based on a pure EV platform, the EV6 gets a flat floor. This has helped designers open a lot of space and give a floating effect to the centre console. Not only does this help make the car feel different, but also opens up a lot of room for storage spaces in the cabin, which we will get to a little later.', '', 'The seats are very comfortable and supportive and have 10-way power adjustability. This helps you get in a natural driving position no matter the size. Also, while charging - these seats can recline to an almost horizontal level (zero-gravity) which helps you relax and nap.\xa0Internationally, the seat covers are built from recycled plastic but in India, the options will include sewed and vegan leather. However, you still get door pads that are built from recycled PET bottles.', 'Features', '', 'The EV6 is packed to the gills with features. Standing on the dashboard are two curved 12.3-inch displays which are for the driver and the infotainment. The display clarity and software smoothness is super slick and easily competes with systems used by Mercedes-Benz. The driver gets a host of different layouts which change with flowing animations and the infotainment also gets simplistic yet useful graphics. I especially like the one with the battery and range display but I wish the car displayed on the screen was the EV6.', '', 'The infotainment is paired with a sweet-sounding 14-speaker Meridian sound system which gets 3D acoustic sound - just like in luxury cars. Other than that, you also get ventilated and heated seats, heated steering, dual-zone climate control, ambient lights, a sunroof, and a 360-degree camera from which you can also remotely monitor your car while it is charging.', '', 'Kia’s first EV for India even gets a full ADAS suite with Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, Emergency Brakes, and more. Special mention in the feature department goes to the heads-up display which gets augmented reality displays for navigation and warnings. It can superimpose the image onto the road ahead to guide you better.', 'Practicality', '', 'As we said, the Kia EV6 is based on an EV-specific platform that helps it offer lots of space and practicality. The storage below the centre console can easily accommodate a small bag and the storage under the armrest too is deep and can also accommodate a small bag. The gadget charging option also comes in plenty with two Type-C, one USB, one 12-Volt, and a wireless charger in the front.

Knee room is generous and the headroom is ample too, but, you can’t stretch your feet under the front seat as there is not enough clearance. The high floor also leads to lacking under-thigh support.

The M Sport grades are available as 6-seaters with middle-row captain seats while the Design Pure Excellence variant can seat 7 with its bench-type middle-row seat. The seats offer good all–round support and comfort with cushioning that’s just firm enough to make even long hours in the seat fatigue-free.', 'However, both the front and rear seats have a slightly short seat base which makes underthigh support for tall users less than ideal. An odd miss is the option of an extendable seat support which would’ve corrected this issue even if integrated manually.', '', 'What’s also missing is the option of massaged seats for any of the occupants, a feature that BMW offers with the X1 for both front passengers! This feature is also missed in the Mercedes-Benz GLS, though Mercedes-Benz does offer the ‘seat kinetics’ program that automatically adjusts the seats with minor movements for users who don’t want to sit completely idle for prolonged periods.

For instance, the top-spec Alpha variant you see here in the pictures can be easily distinguished from the outgoing model. The others need a slightly keen eye.', '', 'It features the new all-LED projector headlamps as well as the LED fog lamps and tail lamps. Not to forget, there’s a chic new design for the 16-inch alloy wheels and some chrome embellishments on the rear bumper too. Lower down the variant chain, aesthetic changes are limited to the redesigned front grille and bumper.', '', 'The new grille is wider and connects the headlamps. We like the subtle underline of chrome as well as the mesh-like detailing. That said, it does remind us of Tata’s ‘Humanity Line’ just a little bit. There’s some added aggression in the bumper by way of a wider air dam and prominent C-shaped outline for the fog lamps.', '', 'Maruti Suzuki hasn’t fiddled around with the side profile or the rear. We’d have loved to see a newer rear end, maybe with a sportier looking bumper. Speaking of sporty, if the vanilla Ciaz doesn’t appeal to you all that much, you can tick a body kit and a spoiler on the accessories list. It definitely looks a lot racier in that avatar.', '', 'So, yes. The Ciaz looks a wee bit fresher than before. It’s not a biblical change but everyone will know you’re driving a Ciaz. And most of them will know you’re driving the new one.', ''], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20180822_215025/526/renault0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'Step inside, and everything around you is familiar. The layout remains identical, so there aren’t any unpleasant surprises here. You’d also appreciate how quickly you’d be at ease in the driver’s seat. All controls fall to hand easily, and more importantly, they’re placed just where you’d want them to be. Be it the interface for the climate control, the switches for the power windows or even the boot release button.', '', 'From the driver’s seat, you’d quickly notice the new additions to the feature list. The new dials (with blue needles, no less) as well as the 4.2-inch coloured MID grabs attention. This display is similar to the one we’ve seen on the Baleno. And while the Power and Torque pie charts seem gimmicky, we still manage to crack a smile while looking at them.', '', 'Second, the right-hand side of the steering wheel is no longer blank. It houses buttons for a feature the Ciaz cried out for — cruise control. The eagle-eyed bunch will also quickly spot that the finish of the wood inserts is now significantly lighter. It’s now finished in a shade Maruti likes to call ‘birch blonde’.', '', 'If you’re being chauffeured around, you will appreciate the sheer kneeroom the Ciaz has to offer. It’s right up there with the Honda City and can house two six-footers one behind the other without a hiccup.', '', 'What should make that journey a tad more comfy is the added adjustable headrests at the rear. Frustratingly, it’s limited to the top two variants only. Also available on only the Zeta and the Alpha is the rear sunshade that should keep you cool when the sun’s bearing down.', '', 'As we’d expect from Maruti, the basics are done right. The floor hump isn’t too tall, the window line isn’t too high and there’s a fabric/leather elbow pad. What could be better though, is the headroom and the underthigh support. Sadly, these snags have been carried over from the outgoing generation along with the good stuff.', '', 'Also, much like the outgoing generation, the Ciaz seems properly well-equipped for the price. Features on the inside include automatic climate control, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system (with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay), rear-AC vents, and a reverse parking camera. The luxury factor is upped by the leather(ette) upholstery, front and rear armrests as well as the leather-wrapped steering wheel. An addition like the sunroof would’ve sealed the deal, but Maruti Suzuki has surprisingly chosen to stay away from the fad.', 'Summing up, the cabin of the Ciaz is equipped well enough to keep the millennial happy, and spacious and comfy enough to make sure Papa bear doesn’t complain either.

Yes, it does have a rather impressive 180mm ground clearance and a tall-boy like stance too. But, there’s no escaping the fact that this looks more like a hopped-up Alto than a scaled-down Brezza.', '', 'There’s an attempt to connect the dots to the Brezza, however. Viewed from the front, the headlamps, toothy grille and that large bumper will remind you a bit of the compact SUV. Bits like the tall and flat bonnet and the sharply raked A-pillar are more cues for you to think it’s got some SUV genes in its design. Viewed dead on, the S-Presso looks tall and narrow. Also (sadly) there’s no spunk here. Nothing that’d make you go wow at first glance. That a basic feature like foglamp has been omitted, and the daytime running lamp is an accessory doesn’t help either.', 'From the side, you’d first notice the lack of alloy wheels even on the top-spec variant. The tiny indicator on the front fender is a straight lift from a twenty-year-old Zen, and that does make you question a few design decisions at Maruti. The S-Presso has XL-sized doors, and Maruti could’ve offered some lower body cladding to help break the monotony of solid colour.', ""The rather bland rear end isn’t anything to write home about. Maybe Maruti Suzuki could've chosen to liven this place up with LED elements in the tail lamps. Even something minor as spreading out the S-Presso badging over the centre of the boot would've added some life to this sedate rear end."", ""Chances are you'd want to slap on some accessories to make your S-Presso stand out a bit. That list includes daytime running lamps (that seem obscenely priced at Rs 10,000), side and wheel arch cladding and alloy wheels. Tick all of them, and you're looking at a cumulative expense of nearly Rs 40,000. With these accessories, the small Suzuki does look a lot more appealing. But then again, it pushes the overall pricing dangerously close to cars from a segment above."", 'Size-wise, the S-Presso is a step up from the Alto — it’s bigger in every measurable way. It’s also the tallest in its class, beating the Kwid by a significant 74mm. But in every other department, the Kwid takes the upper hand.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20191006_192629/638/maruti0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The doors on the S-Presso open wide, and you can simply walk into the cabin. Compared to the Alto and Kwid where you have to lower yourself into the car, this is much easier. The tiny dashboard, the quirky circular element in the centre and the centrally-mounted speedometer all grab attention instantly. On our orange test car, the bezels on the centre console and side AC vents were colour coordinated. Pick any other exterior colour, and you get a silver finish here. Quality levels here seem acceptable for a car this size. It’s a couple of notches up from the Alto, and a notch below the WagonR.', 'Once in, you’ll agree that Maruti Suzuki has managed to eke out some serious space from a car this small. It’s a genuine family car that can seat four six-footers with ease. And that’s a surprise! The first part of the surprise is the cabin width. Despite being narrower by almost 60mm compared to the Kwid, the S-Presso manages to deliver better shoulder room. At the front, you’ll notice the power window switches on the centre console. That saves some vital real estate on the door pad. Then, the door pads itself are super narrow — giving you those crucial extra millimetres of width. Headroom at the front shouldn’t be a problem unless you’re way above 6ft tall. Surprisingly, the Alto offers more here.', 'Maruti has opted for super soft cushioning for the seats. And this feels comfy, if you’re out and about for a small city sprint. However, if you had to spend upwards of an hour or two in these seats, you’d wish they were a little firmer. On a related note, the seats feel narrow and could’ve done with more bolstering too. You also miss out on adjustable headrests, but the integrated unit does support the neck and head adequately.', 'It’s delivering enough on storage spaces at the front too. There’s a small glovebox, a handy shelf above it for your wallet and phone and 1-litre bottle holders on the door. The floor console gets a couple of cup holders and a small cubby for some knick-knacks. Except for maybe the cubby feeling slightly small for large-screened phones, you shouldn’t have any complaints with storage space at the front. Sadly, that’s not something we can say about the rear. Save for the small rectangular cubby on the floor (behind the handbrake) - there’s absolutely nothing. No door pockets, and no seatback pockets even.', 'Gloss over that for a bit, and you’re met with surprise number two. Knee room! The S-Presso is a big leap ahead compared to the Alto, and noticeably more than the Kwid too. In fact, compare the numbers to the Ignis (that’s a bigger car, with a bigger wheelbase) and the S-Presso manages to outshine that as well. Here, headroom is ample even for those slightly taller than six feet. What’s likely to be a bother are the integrated headrests. It barely supports the base of the neck for someone who’s 5’8”-5’10”. If you’re taller still, you’re left with virtually no support.', '*Front seat adjusted for 5\'8"" to 6\' occupants.', '', 'It’s a bit much to expect a car this small to be able to seat five. Naturally, three abreast at the rear is super tight, and definitely not recommended. It’s a comfortable four-seater that leaves ample room for everyone when used as one. And the 270-litre boot is more than happy to swallow luggage too. We could put in two backpacks and two overnighters with ease and had some room to spare for another backpack.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20191006_192822/638/maruti0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

Up front, you now get a larger single frame octagonal grille with vertical chrome slats, featuring Audi’s famous ‘Quattro’ badge. Audi has now equipped the Q7 with Matrix LED headlights and dapper tri-arrow LED DRLs. These units can control the beam to avoid dazzling the oncoming vehicles by controlling each LED element.', ""Further down, the facelifted SUV comes with a revised front bumper with bigger air dams and a faux skid plate to round off the fascia. The international-spec Q7, however, gets HD Matrix LED tech comprising laser lights that help in better illumination. But you can't have those here, not even as an option."", '', 'Its profile now features redesigned 19-inch alloy wheels, which, though handsome, should have at least been in dual-tone finish to make them more alluring. Audi has provided the SUV with running boards (optional) to ease the ingress and egress, especially for older passengers. Also, this is the angle where it looks most like an estate. However, the SUV has now grown a bit longer, resulting in a better road presence than before.', '', 'At the rear, the updates include a revised bumper with a faux skid plate and updated LED tail lights (with a chrome underline), resembling the headlights with the same tri-arrow pattern. And not to forget, the facelifted Q7 gets dynamic turn indicators in typical Audi fashion. Although Audi has tried to work its way around with a couple of nip-and-tucks to make the Q7 look more dominating on the road, it still looks more like an understated station wagon than an outright SUV.

Right from the door pads, to the dashboard, to the steering wheel, everything feels plush and has a soft-touch feel to it. Additionally, the facelifted Q7 also has a new dashboard layout borrowed from the current-gen Audis with a piano black finish, and aluminium and wood finishes to take the luxury factor up by a few notches.', 'Features and Technology', '', 'With the mid-life update, the Q7 now comes with Audi’s latest MMI software for its new 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system and the smaller 8.6-inch display for climate control, below the main infotainment screen. It can also double up as a writing pad to input information. Both the screens perform their tasks seamlessly, are prompt to respond, and offer improved haptic feedback when used.', 'A downside, though, is that Audi has now done away with the swivel controller from the centre console for the touchscreen-integrated operations which makes you take your eyes off the road for operating select functions. However, the driver has the option to use voice commands to operate the climate control, navigation and multimedia to tackle this problem.', '', 'One of the highlights of the updated equipment list surely has to be the digital driver’s display, or in Audi speak, the Virtual Cockpit. It’s a well-integrated digital display which has all the necessary information sorted in a very organised manner. And here’s the best part- its inbuilt navigation display can be adjusted to fit the full screen to better help while driving.', '', 'Other features on board the flagship Audi SUV are the new 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, four-zone climate control, 30-colour ambient lighting, puddle lamps on all four doors, air quality sensor with fragrance, and rain-sensing wipers. But there are some glaring omissions such as ventilated seats and electric adjustment for the steering wheel. Also missing, as compared to the international-spec SUV, are connected car tech, Alexa voice activation, head-up display, Google Earth navigation, and optional rear wheel steering.', ""One thing that remains unchanged for the Q7 is that the cabin is large and spacious and offers generous amounts of seating space for six to seven adult occupants. Let's dive into it."", 'Front Row', '', 'The front row of seats are large and accommodating, helping the driver and co-passenger feel comfortable even on longer drives. Also, the high-seating position ensures you get a wide and clear view outside.', 'Middle Row', '', 'Special attention has been given to the second row of seats, as most of the owners are likely to spend the majority of their travel time here. The seats are very well cushioned and let you sink into them with the padding. Each of the three seats here can slide and recline individually to get into a more relaxed posture. Audi has also ensured that there’s space in abundance here as three occupants can sit without the shoulders rubbing. While there’s a sufficient amount of headroom for even six-footers, the central transmission tunnel does eat into the middle passenger’s legroom.', '', 'There is no lack of features here and you get two optional Android-powered tablets, B-pillar-mounted and central AC vents, and dual-zone climate control. You also get an armrest with cupholders, a panoramic sunroof, type-C charging ports, a 12V socket, and window shades. However, for a proper boss seat experience, we wish Audi could have given a wireless phone charger and controls for the front passenger seat.', 'Third Row', '', 'If you are planning to frequently travel with more than five people or have a big family, the third row of seats will come as a blessing. The second-row seats can fold and tumble in a two-step process, with hydraulic assist in the last stage, offering easy ingress and egress. While the third-row seats seem good enough for city journeys even for adults, occupants will mostly be required to sit in a squatting position due to the low seating layout.

There is a soft touch pad on the left side of the dashboard and overall, the finish of the white plastic, silver finish and the chrome is quite premium. Even the rotary dials for the manual AC and the drive selector are quite tactile. Apart from the size, the cabin feels well appointed for a car that will cost north of 15 lakh.', '', 'Highlights include the dual 10.25-inch screens that make up the touchscreen infotainment and the instrument cluster.

Q5 Technology: Rs.70.45 Lakh*Get On-Road Price",,,AWD,"{'Exterior': ['', ""At a glance, Audi looks to have shed the pre-facelift Q5’s ‘corporate’ design and have gone more towards a sportier look. Up front, you get a fresh face thanks to a new front grille featuring chrome vertical slats. You’ll notice some familiarity here, as it's similar to its larger sibling, the Q8. Next up is a bolder bumper, and new LED headlights that are paired with a snazzier set of DRLs."", ""Elsewhere, you get a new set of alloy wheels which are now 19-inch units instead of the 18-inch wheels from before. Head over to the rear, and the tail light internals have been tweaked for a slightly more aggressive look. Unfortunately, it's not the organic LED (OLED) taillights with selectable light patterns sold in markets abroad, but will likely arrive later as part of a tertiary update."", '', 'Audi is offering the 2021 Q5 in five colour options: Ibis White, Mythos Black, Navarra Blue, Manhattan Gray, and Floret Silver. For us, it was the Navarra Blue that stood out amongst others, fitting any kind of scenery from bright sunny days, to low-light sunsets.', 'Overall, the design changes have given the Q5 more of an identity of its own, and it does manage to grab eyeballs while not necessarily being something in-your-face, which is something suitable for someone looking for a finely balanced luxury SUV.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20211029_084016/742/audi0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'It comes as no surprise that the Q5 gets a well organised cabin with everything placed in the right areas, with a proper fit and finish to comprise a good looking layout. That being said, the Q5 could’ve done with more soft-touch material as a lot of the cabin features hard plastics which bring the premium quotient down. Nonetheless its layout feels modern enough compared to the BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.', 'Hard plastics aside, the Q5 does manage to get the ‘comfort’ factor right with its well cushioned and supportive seats covered in leatherette + leather upholstery. Seated up front, there’s plenty of room to stretch your legs for the passenger, and you won’t feel tired on a long road trip. The same can be said for the rear seats for those who would rather be chauffeur-driven. There is ample cushioning, good legroom and under thigh support, there are rear AC vents, and you can pop-out a cup holder from the middle seat to be seated in comfort. The SUV as a whole is perfect for a family of four, but for those that are quite tall, that leg room might fall a little short. Also, because of the seat contouring and cabin width, squeezing in a third passenger will make the other two a bit uncomfortable.', 'Features', '', ""Now to what’s really changed in the SUV. You’re treated to a new 10.1-inch infotainment system which is now finally a touchscreen unit. Using the infotainment system was a breeze with no lag, and an interface that has easy access menus for media, connectivity, car settings, as well as navigation. It comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, but it's not a wireless feature. What’s wireless though, is the phone charger."", 'Another important addition to the Q5 is a 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen music system considering its rival, the Volvo XC60 has a 15-speaker Bowers & Wilkins setup. Whether you’re listening to Pink Floyd, or Ed Sheeran, this extensive sound system manages to play these tunes effortlessly with top notch quality. Thanks to the speakers being integrated into the doors, dashboard and even the pillars, the surround sound fills the entire cabin. That being said, you will notice a bit of blaring when playing music at full blast. Credit also should be given to the great cabin noise insulation, so you can listen away comfortably even in the middle of a traffic jam riddled area at a lower volume.', '', 'Other notable bits in the 2021 Q5 include three-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, powered front seats with driver memory function, as well as a powered tailgate with hands free operation. Also who can forget Audi’s Virtual Cockpit digital driver’s display that can be customized into a variety of combinations.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20211029_083755/742/audi0.jpg'}",5 Star,,,,237  kmph,,,,,

Also, the antenna which used to be on top of the car, has now been integrated into the windshield, which itself is made of corning gorilla glass. As such, it is now less prone to scratches and cracks when off-roading and your antenna stays safe too. The rear, on the other hand, is the same as before.', '', 'But the “I don’t want to see this in my ORVM” Wrangler is the accessorised one which we had. It has the same design as the regular Wrangler Rubicon, but comes with an open top, tubular doors, and some accessories.

Jeep has redesigned the dashboard which now gets a leather finish, making it look just as premium as it is rugged. The design of the AC buttons and centre console is the same as before, but they are sealed shut to make them water-resistant.', 'And these new bits not only look premium, they feel premium as well. The quality of the materials used is appreciable, as everything inside the cabin feels right for the price. The buttons on the steering wheel, centre console, and climate control feel very tactile and the leather padding on the dashboard is also nice to touch. Even during heavy off-roading, when you along with the car will be bouncing around, you’ll not hear any rattle coming from any part of the cabin. Also, just like the outgoing version, the 2024 Wrangler still has washable interiors.', '', 'Now we come to the seats. These big seats with their huge contours try to keep you in place, but will bounce you around during serious off-roading. And yet, that will not hinder your comfort as you’ll be enjoying seeing what the car is capable of. You get a decent amount of headroom here (we had the open top version so we can’t really judge), the cushioning is soft, and for convenience, both front seats are 12-way power adjustable and wrapped in nappa leather (in the Rubicon variant). But this is not the only feature addition.', '', 'The controls for the aforementioned 12-way powered front seats are also sealed to be water resistant, giving the new Wrangler uncompromised water-wading capability, and when it comes to features, Jeep has added a few new ones to up the premium factor.', '', 'It now comes with a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system that runs smoothly and supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. There’s also a 552W Alpine sound system,\xa0 a 7-array microphone for noise cancellation that can block outside noise even in the open-top version, and a dedicated off-road camera housed in the grille which is actually very useful. Jeep has also added heated front seats and a heated steering wheel, handy for the bare-frame version we had if the climate was cooler, or perhaps even for a night drive.', '', 'Apart from all this, the Wrangler also offers features like a semi-digital instrument cluster with a 7-inch TFT multi-information display, dual-zone climate control, push-button start/stop, and an auto-dimming IRVM. In the 2024 Wrangler, you get more than what you expect from an off-roader but that’s where the lifestyle element comes in.', 'In terms of practicality, you get the basic 1-litre bottle holders on all doors, 2 cupholders in the centre console, 2 cupholders in the rear centre armrest along with a slot to keep your phone, a small glove box, storage in the centre armrest, and seat back pockets.', '', 'While the front seats of the new Wranger are as premium and comfortable as it gets, the same can be said for the rear seats. Jeep does call the Wrangler a 5-seater, but 3 people in the back of the Wrangler is one too many. Fitting 2 people in the back would be better, so both passengers get enough room to sit comfortably, but even then, the lack of underthigh support will make things a little uncomfortable.', 'But you don’t really sit in the back seat of the Wrangler to commute.

In the 180mm of ground clearance, confident SUV-like styling and a smattering of cladding on the bumpers it does enough to warrant that badge. Citroen insists it’s a premium hatchback with an SUV twist, possibly in a bid to separate it from the whole host of sub-4-metre SUVs already on sale.', '', 'In terms of size, the Citroen C3 looks like a powerlifter compared to hatchbacks like the Celerio, WagonR and Tiago. It can go shoulder to shoulder with the likes of the Magnite and Kiger too. There’s obvious C5 inspiration in the design. The high bonnet, the flared wheel arches and rounded bumpers make the C3 seem cute, yet powerful.', 'The front borrows Citroen’s global signature of a sleek chrome grille flowing into daytime running lamps. But those are the only LEDs you’ll see on the car. The headlamps, turn-indicators, fog lamps and the tail lamps are of the basic halogen variety. There are some more signs of the C3’s simplicity in the antenna, the flap style door handles and the indicators on the fenders instead of the mirrors.', 'Citroen is banking on customisation to stand out. The Citroen C3 is available in four monotone shades and six dual tone options. There are three customisation packs and two interior trims to choose from. You could also pick and choose from a plethora of accessories to personalize your C3. One accessory we wish came fitted from the factory? Alloy wheels! The wheel caps look smart, but the optional alloy wheels make the C3 look a whole lot better.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20220614_181156/781/citroen0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['Interior Space And Practicality', '', 'With its upright stance and wide-opening doors, it’s easy to get in and out of the Citroen C3. Seating is high-set, which means elders in the family will appreciate this too. Citroen is also quick to point out that the rear seat is set 27mm higher compared to the front to ensure that occupants get a better view out and not keep staring at the front seat backs all the while.', '', 'For the driver, getting in a comfortable position is fairly straightforward. The seat adjusts for height, and there’s tilt-adjust for the steering as well. New drivers will appreciate the high seating position and the view it affords. With narrow pillars and large windows, it’s easy to get used to the size of the car and feel comfortable with its dimensions. It’s here where you begin to realise how cleverly packaged the Citroen C3 really is. The dashboard is narrow and upright, liberating more room for the front occupants.', 'You wouldn’t feel cramped in the front seats even if you’re a six-footer. We particularly like the amount of width on offer — it’s unlikely you’ll be brushing shoulders with your co-driver. The seats by themselves are comfortable, even for those with larger frames. That said, Citroen should not have skipped out on adjustable headrests, even though the fixed headrests offer good support and are cushioned well.', 'Adjustable headrests would’ve been great at the rear too. Taller occupants will have to move further ahead in their seats to make use of the fixed ones Citroen provides. This aside, the rear of the C3 is a comfortable place to be. There’s ample kneeroom, a raised front seat ensures foot room and the scooped out headliner means there’s more than enough headroom for a six-footer here too.', 'Helping you get comfortable in the cabin is a stellar air-conditioning system. At full blast, it’s sure to leave you wanting for a sweater. In hot and muggy Goa, we never needed to keep the fan speed above 2 — that’s how good the air-con is!', 'In terms of practicality, the C3 leaves little to want for. All doors have 1-litre bottle holders, the centre stack gets a shelf, a cubby hole and a couple of cupholders. There’s some more storage space under and behind the handbrake too. You’d appreciate the little details too — such as grooves to route your phone cable around the air-con controls, and a recess in the rear mobile holder to ensure your cable doesn’t get pinched while charging.', '', '', '', 'Finishing things off is a 315-litre boot, enough for a weekend getaway’s luggage. There’s no 60:40 split seats here, but you can fold the rear seat down for added room.', 'Interior Quality And Features', 'For what’s intended to be a budget-car, plastics used in the C3’s cabin are a pleasant surprise. It’s expectedly hard, but you’d like the textures Citroen has used — whether it’s on the top half of the dashboard, the door pads and even the bottle holders in the doors. The (optional) bright orange central element that splits the dashboard has an interesting pattern too. You’d also see some thought in the way the central AC vents have a damped action and the wiper/light stalks have a satisfying click.', 'The C3 will feel disappointing if you like your cars with the latest features. Other than the infotainment that we’ll speak about in just a bit, there’s barely anything to speak of. Basics of four power windows, manual air-conditioning, fabric upholstery aside, there really isn’t anything else. Must-haves such as power adjustable/folding mirrors, day/night IRVM, adjustable headrests and armrests have been suspiciously skipped. It’s also concerning that Citroen chose to not offer a rear defogger and wiper even in the top-spec model.', '', 'The instrument cluster is a tiny digital display that shows nothing more than the odometer, speed, average efficiency and distance to empty. Citroen could’ve considered adding climate control, better instrumentation, powered mirrors and rear wiper/defogger at the least and maybe a reversing camera too.', 'Infotainment', 'Citroen is offering a 10.2-inch touchscreen in the top-spec C3. The screen is big on real estate, has a fluid and simple interface and is quick to respond.

The new seats with fabric upholstery are supportive and comfortable and even wear an embroidered Gurkha badge. Once seated though, the steering wheel feels a bit too large and old school. The finish is average and it has no controls for audio/calls either. And despite it now getting tilt and telescopic adjustment, taller drivers will still feel it to be a bit low and very close to the thighs.

Two in the front along with a 12V socket, and two at the back. Again, while this unit is acceptable for an off-road-focused Gurkha, passenger cars of all shapes and sizes have moved on to offer more sophisticated systems.

All three passenger seats also get ISOFIX child seat mounts. However, even in our short drive, the sensors started to malfunction. The TPMS is an aftermarket unit and on multiple cars, the reading kept on fluctuating and at times went to zero, which triggered an alarm and became annoying. The passenger seatbelt reminder started beeping even without the passenger and the reverse parking sensors sensed things that weren't there. We hope these sensors are fixed in the production car."", '', 'In terms of cabin practicality, you get two cupholders, dedicated mobile storage and coin storage in the centre console. Door pockets are rather thin and can only hold juice\xa0boxes and papers. The glovebox has become bigger in this generation and can accommodate knick-knacks. The rear-seat passengers, however, get no storage.', '', 'Speaking of the rear seats, you now get two captain seats instead of the benches. Getting in only happens from the rear door and it’s pretty comfortable. These seats are large and comfortable and get armrests of their own. You can recline them for more comfort but they do not slide, not that you will have any lack of knee room. The view outside is unobstructed with the large glass panel and because you are seated much higher than the front occupants, even the front view is clear.

Even the key feels really premium. Surely, this is a new high for Hyundai in India.', '', 'There is no lack of features either. The front seats are power-adjustable and get heat, and ventilation and the driver seat gets lumbar and memory functions as well. The centre console consists of a full touch panel which looks delicate, but we much rather prefer physical controls, as they are easier to use on the go. You also get 64-colour ambient lighting.', '', 'The screens are both 10.25 inches and have excellent resolution. The instrument cluster gets various themes and like the Alcazar, gets blind spot displays. The infotainment is very premium as well with an HD display and a smooth interface. Other highlights include an 8-speaker Bose sound system, voice commands and multiple language support.', '', 'The model launched in India is the long-wheelbase Tucson. This means there is a proper focus on the rear seat experience. In terms of space, there is plenty of leg, knee and headroom on offer - possibly the best in the segment. Furthermore, you get the ‘Boss’ mode front passenger seat controls with which you can open up more space. Just recline the rear seat, and this is a proper boss seat rivalling the likes of sedans like Skoda Superb and Toyota Camry.', '', 'Features here include AC vents, USB charging ports and an armrest with cup holders.

The 18-inch dual-tone wheels look stunning and the overall boxy proportion gives the Meridian a lot of presence.', 'From the front, it looks unmistakable like a Jeep, thanks to the signature seven-slat grille and slim headlamps. On the downside, the Meridian is not a wide car as a result when looked at head-on it doesn’t look a lot bigger as compared to the Compass.

So you get the same elegant dash layout with the 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system taking centre stage. The biggest highlight of the cabin though is the quality. Everywhere you touch or feel you get soft-touch materials and all the knobs and switches feel premium in the way they look and function. The dual-tone black and brown colour combination elevates the cabin ambience and overall the Meridian’s cabin is right up there with the best at this price point.', 'The Meridian being narrow reflects in the cabin as well. It doesn’t give you a big SUV feeling be it in the first or in the second row, where the cabin feels narrow and you don’t get the sense of space that you would expect from a car at this price point.', '', 'In terms of comfort, the powered front seats are large and have a long range of adjustments which makes finding an ideal seating position easy. The seat cushioning is on the firm side, which should make them feel supportive and comfortable even over long journeys. The middle-row seats too are comfortable with great under-thigh support and the adjustable backrest lets you find a comfortable seating position. Knee-room in the middle row is adequate, while the headroom is surprisingly tight. Anyone over six feet will end up touching their head on the roof liner.', ""Now let's talk about the third row. For an adult knee room is tight and the low seat gives you a knees-up seating position. It's a shame the Meridian doesn’t have a sliding middle-row to generate more knee room for the third-row passengers. Surprisingly, headroom is impressive even for tall people. So the third row of the Meridian is alright for short journeys."", '', 'In terms of practicality, the Meridian fares fairly well. Upfront you have a good amount of storage spaces and two USB charging ports. The front door pockets, however, are not that large and apart from a bottle holder, there is not much space to store other knick-knacks. Middle-row passengers get a foldable centre armrest with two cup holders, two bottle holders and seatback pockets. Unfortunately, you get just one USB charging port here and it also lacks some feel-good features like a foldable tray or sunblinds.', 'With the third row folded, the 481- litre of space is more than enough to carry a weekend’s worth of luggage for five people. With the third row up you just get 170-litres of space which is good to carry two soft bags.', 'Features', '', 'The features list of the Meridian is very similar to that of the Compass.

It has all the traits you can expect from an SUV, like an upright front grille which is designed in layers. The bonet has ample muscle and even the wheel arches are flared. Add the all around cladding and the stylish 17-inch alloy wheels to this design and it is probability the most “SUV-looking” SUV in the segment', '', ""While this SUV is not lacking in looks, the simplicity comes from the feature elements. The key is very simple and you don't get passive keyless entry. Then comes the lighting setup. All lights apart from the DRLs are halogens. And even the DRLs are not the clean strip DRLs. So from that point of view - it does leave a bit to be desired. Now, it depends on you whether you like the car or not. If you want a little fanciness from your car, you want your car to be a little loud, then you may not like it. But if your focus is only on the looks of the car and on being simple, then the C3 Aircross will impress you.""], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64d21f45a9521.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['The access to the third row is easy. You just have to pull a strap on the left second-row seat and it will tumble and fold. You’d still have to be careful about the roof height, but you do get a lot of space to access the third row.', '', ""Like any other small 3-row SUV, the seats are placed quite low. But other than that one thing I honestly can't complain about is the space. I am 5'7” and my knees did not touch the front row and you can slide your feet under the second row as well. The headroom is a little compromised – if there is a big bump, you might touch it – but otherwise, this seat is practical for city journeys. Even the width is ample for two adults to sit without rubbing shoulders."", ""What adds to the practicality are the features. Rear passengers get their own cup holders and USB chargers. And in the 7-seater variant, you also get roof-mounted AC vents over the second row with blower controls. The airflow is good and even the third-row passengers won't feel hot. However, these are purely air circulation vents and the cabin needs to first cool down for them to blow cold air, which will take some time on hot days. The only real issues are:\xa0 you sit very close to the rear windscreen, and the all-around visibility is not good. The quarter glass is tiny and the front seats are tall."", 'The second-row experience is also surprisingly comfortable. There is ample legroom and knee room for even taller passengers to be comfortable. The seat base extensions help with better underthigh support, and the backrest angle is relaxed too. The only minor concern here is that the seatback bolstering is underwhelming. This, while good when seating three people, lacks support when only two passengers are seated.', '', 'While the seats and space are good, the C3 aircross lacks features. Missing things like a centre armrest with cupholders is an absolute shame and even the roof-mounted AC vents are exclusive to the 7-seater variants which means the 5-seater variants don’t get any rear AC vents. These features are offered in hatchbacks and definitely should have been there in a Rs 15 lakh+ SUV. The only features you get are door armrests, two USB chargers, and a bottle holder in the door.', 'From the driver’s seat, the C3 Aircross feels just like the C3. The dashboard design, tall seating and all other elements like the steering and the features are mostly shared. This means, the cabin doesnt feel as big as the competitors, but more comparable to that of the sub-4 metre SUV.', '', 'While this cabin is quite basic, Citroen has used the right materials and quality at the right place to elevate the experience. The seats are semi-leatherette, the driver armrest feels premium and the leather on the door pad too feels good to touch. The steering wheel, again, has a leather wrap and this experience ends here.', 'Like its platform twins, the C3 Aircross excels in practicality. The door pockets are of a good size, where you can fit 1-litre bottles and you still have space to keep more stuff. There is a dedicated tray to keep your mobile phone and a deep pocket where you can keep your wallet and keys. There are two cup holders and you get a cubbyhole behind the gear shifter as well. Finally, the glove box is also of good size. The small space you see above the glovebox is just for show and not really a storage area. At the back, you get a bottle holder in the centre console and two bottle holders for the third row.', '', 'Talking about charging options, you have a USB port and a 12V socket in the front. Apart from this, you get two USB chargers in the middle and two USB chargers in the third row. If there was a Type C port here, it would have been better.', '', ""Finally, let's talk about the features. As mentioned earlier, this car is not trying to win your heart with features. So while the basic requirements are all fulfilled here, the ‘want’ list is missing. The basics, like steering-mounted controls, manual AC, electrically adjustable ORVMs, digital instrument cluster with a good display and various modes and themes, a Tyre Pressure Warning System, a big 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and a 6-speaker sound system are all accounted for. That said, the ‘want’ list, like cruise control, ventilated seats, automatic climate control, auto day/night IRVM or a sunroof are all missing. And because of this, it is very important for this car to come at a lower price point. In essence, the top variant of the C3 Aircross will have a feature experience equivalent to the lower to mid-spec variants of rival SUVs.""], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64d2208fe540a.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

Mahindra’s design team have taken inspiration for the front grill, the fog lamps, the antena and the rear tail lamps from the apex predator. The teeth on the front grill do give the otherwise happy face a menacing look and combine nicely with the smoked projector headlamps. The proportions are very MUV with a bonnet line that does flow smoothly into the roof line through the front windshield in a very van-like manner, but the accent lines on the side give it a nice aggressive canted forward stance that’s quite sporty. The machine cut 17-inch alloys are also anything but boring and add a further dollop of flair to the side profile. At the rear, the real standouts are those large taillights that mimic a shark’s tail in shape and size complimented with a large chrome strip that runs across the entire rear hatch.', '', 'Unlike the in the TVC, the Marazzo actually looks quite attractive in the flesh. At 4585mm long, it’s larger than the diminutive Renault Lodgy or the Maruti Ertiga, similar in stature to the Toyota Innova (which is 150mm longer) and feels a lot smaller than the mighty 4788mm long Tata Hexa.', ''], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20180926_155255/561/mahindra0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The interiors of the Marazzo which were designed in collaboration with inhouse design studio Pininfarina, were a pleasant surprise. Our first impressions were that there was a lot of space on offer in all three rows and a proper road test, with the captain-seat version filled to capacity, proved that this is quite true. Let’s start with the front row, where the seats are nice and comfortable even if they are lacking slightly in under-thigh support. The tall driving position gives the driver a good view of the road and the light coloured interiors help enhance that feeling of space. The design of the dash and instrument cluster is also modern and quite attractive, especially the way everything lights up in purple post sunset.', '', 'The seats in the second row like the front are comfortable but sport a 20mm longer seat base, taking care of the shortage of under thigh support in the first row. The roof-mounted AC vents are fully adjustable and you can even close off the venting completely, but the icing on the cake is the diffuse mode. On a hot day, once the cabin has cooled down completely, or on a normal even drive, switching to diffuse mode distributes the airflow evenly around the cabin so you’re not troubled with an extra cold spot where the blower is pointing. One complaint for the second row though is that the door storage is nearly impossible to reach with the door closed. So things like water bottles and other nicknacks will have to be accessed only when you’re parked on the side of the road. Another miss is the number of charging points as there is just one 12v socket in the front row with 2 USB ports and just one USB in the second row for charging.', '', 'The third row also fits fully grown adults in comfort. Though three abreast is a squeeze on account of the rear mounted secondary AC unit taking up space on the right hand side of the car, two adults will be comfortable in this space even on longer road trips.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20180926_155359/561/mahindra0.jpg'}",4 Star,,,,,,,,,

So, no, you won’t get the same commanding road presence you would with similarly priced rivals. Truth be told, the crossover stance and curvy styling would have you thinking this is a larger and more purpose-built version of the i20 Active.', 'What will mainly get you eyeballs in the Kona EV are two factors. First, the quirky styling. The faux front grille (where the charging port is hidden) and the unusually styled 17-inch alloy wheels, combined with the distinctive black body cladding, especially on the rear fender, do make the Kona electric look interesting, if not beautiful.', '', 'The second attention grabber is the car’s rarity. Even a year down the line, it’s unlikely the Kona will be as common a sight as a Jeep Compass or Tata Harrier.

And that’s where the Kona EV’s charm lies. Most people interested in the Kona may not have driven or even been in an electric car before but once you’re in, nothing seems unfamiliar.', '', 'The overall visibility is great, and everything from the drive mode button (Eco, Eco+, Sport & Comfort) to the button-type drive selector (park, neutral, reverse & drive) fall to your hand with ease. What’s different vs say, the Tucson or Creta is that the centre console of the Kona EV sits high up and is finished in dull silver. Combine this with the low-slung seating and you get a driving position that’s akin to a hatchback’s or sedan’s. It’s not a tall driving position like in the Venue or Creta, where your line of sight is above the bonnet.', 'While the Kona EV’s low height doesn’t present any issues for headroom, drivers over 6ft tall will have to set the driver’s seat height at a lower point. However, you are aware that this isn’t a very big car.', '', 'The cabin space, particularly at the rear, is on par with some sub-10 lakh Rupee premium hatchbacks. The knee room and headroom at the rear, while usable for 6-footers, isn’t what you’d get from petrol-/diesel-powered SUVs at the same price point. A bigger problem in the rear, though, is how close the seat base is to the floor. So even users under 6ft in height will not be able to use the underthigh support, since the seating position pushes your knees up.', '', 'We have to face some facts: The Kona EV would’ve undoubtedly been cheaper had it been made in India. At the moment, it is being assembled here with imported parts, which is why it’s priced on par with larger cars. In fact, it is cheaper in India than it is in Hyundai’s home market, South Korea, and even Hyundai India admits this isn’t a model they’re expecting any profits from. Why are we mentioning this? It’s simply to provide perspective that this isn’t meant to rival the big SUVs it does and its pricing is simply a function of how it’s being produced for sale in India.', '', 'Expectedly, even the boot space isn’t on par with its price rivals. While the Tucson gives you 530 litres, the Compass gives you 438 litres & even the Creta gives you 402 litres of trunk space, you only get about 334 litres with the Kona EV.

Upfront, the large gaping grille with the three-pointed star in the centre dominates and gives the car loads of presence. In profile, the swooping lines make it look quite elegant and the 17-inch wheels on the Avantgarde variant look quite attractive.

The rear bumper too is well designed with the faux diffuser cutting visual mass.', 'The C300d comes in the AMG-line variant, which adds a dash of sportiness to the overall design. It gets a more aggressive-looking grille and front bumper, flared side sills and a larger set of 18-inch alloy wheels.', '', 'The new generation Mercedes C-Class is based on the same MRA II platform as the S-Class. When compared with its predecessor, it is 65mm longer, 10mm wider and sports a 25mm longer wheelbase which has translated into moreroom in the back.

Unabashedly ‘inspired’ by the new S-Class, the W206 Mercedes C-Class has a similarly styled central console with the 11.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system taking centre stage. The overall design is stunning and so beautifully executed that the C-Class’s cabin has a sense of occasion that no other sedan at this price point has.', '', 'The layered dash design looks luxurious thanks to the use of wood and the air-con vents, which are inspired by fighter-jet afterburners, are not only beautifully designed, but the way they function with satisfying clicks every time you move them tells you just how well engineered they are.', '', 'The C-Class also gets the same Sienna Brown upholstery as the S-Class, which adds to the overall ambience of the car. Although the design and ambience of the new C-Class’s cabin is unparalleled, in terms of quality Mercedes has cut corners a bit. In the lower half portion of the cabin, Mercedes has used hard plastics and, when compared with the BMW 3 Series, it lacks consistency.', '', 'The 11.9-inch high-resolution infotainment uses the latest MBUX tech that we have seen on the latest S-Class. It has a bright vibrant display with big icons and the processing speed is top-notch too. In this system, you can also save driver profiles which memorises preferred seat position, sound settings, air-con settings and sunshade position too. You also get a voice command system which gets activated when you say ‘Hey Mercedes’ through which you can control a lot of car functions.', '', 'You also get a digital driver display which is crisp, shows you loads of information and you can also customise it to your liking. Just like in the S-Class, many of the controls are now touch-based for a ‘modern’ interactive experience. There are loads of capacitive touch controls like the steering wheel-mounted buttons, ORVM adjust buttons and the swipe function to open the sunroof.', '', 'In terms of comfort, the front seats are large and supportive which makes them comfortable even for long journeys. You can also set the driver seat really low for a sporty driving position or high up if you want a better view out while driving in heavy traffic. The one thing that we missed however is front seat ventilation which should have been offered at this price point.', '', 'The real upgrade has happened at the rear though. Unlike its predecessors, the new C-Class has a spacious back seat with a good knee room and headroom. The seat too is supportive with good back support and decent under-thigh support. On the downside, because the seat is placed quite low, getting in and out of the rear seat is not the easiest.', '', 'In terms of practicality, the C-Class performs well. Upfront you get loads of storage and the same goes for the rear as well. The only thing that the rear passengers might crib about are the lack of phone charging ports.', 'Features', '', 'When it comes to features, the C-Class, in the Avantgarde trim, comes with powered front seats with memory function, powered steering adjust, digital instrument cluster, 11.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, dual zone climate control, panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, onboard 3D maps and connected car features. Additionally in the C300d AMG-Line, you get laser LED headlamps, larger 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel and a Burmester sound system.

Gone is the two-slat design, replaced by an even classier single-slat design. It’s also been given a 3D effect with lots of chrome studded elements in the background that remind one of a night sky filled with stars. The headlamps have also been given an update--the ones on the AMG-Line variant we had with us made use of LED projector headlamps. The 18-inch alloy wheels have a simple yet elegant design that gel well with the design of the E-Class. At the rear Mercedes has given the tail lamps a do over, and they now protrude into the boot lid. Their overall design has also seen a big change, and this is one of the ways you can instantly separate this new E-Class and the pre-facelift model before it. A cool feature about these tail lights is that they can adjust their brightness based on the ambient lighting conditions, just like your smartphone screen.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20210505_114904/723/mercedes-benz0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The interior of the E-Class was class-leading before, and even with only minor changes, it maintains that advantage. The AMG-Line variant we had with us had a deep blue and beige dual-tone interior. There are grey accents all over the place that match well with the other two colours. As far as the changes are concerned, there is a redesigned steering wheel, a wireless charging pad for the front passengers, touch functionality for the touchscreen unit and a fully programmable display for the driver. Both screens, like before, can be operated using the touch buttons on the steering wheel but the learning curve is a little steep at first, and these buttons will take some getting used to. Mercedes has also added some fun bits, like for example if you key in your height, the seats and the ORVMs will automatically adjust to a preset position. Now this is not the most ideal setting but it’s a good starting point. This can be done for both the driver and passenger seats.', '', 'There are some misses too, that we felt the E-Class could have done with. Firstly, the augmented reality that overlay navigation prompts over a live video feed from the front camera would have been a cool addition to the E-Class. This is available in the S-Class for now. Another S-Class feature we would have appreciated is “energising comfort.” It basically brings the music, ambient lighting and the seat massager in harmony to deliver a more connected and comfortable experience. For that matter, massage seats or cooled seats would have been much appreciated, seeing as the latter is now available in Rs 15 lakh cars.', '', 'As far as the boss seat is concerned, things are the same as before. You get ample amount of space in the rear, the seats can recline--and if you need more space, you can simply push the passenger seat all the way to the front at the touch of a button. You continue to get control of all the sunblinds and the sunroof from the rear, and the tablet in the armrest adds even more functionality. You can access most of the car’s touchscreen controls from it.

Lexus talks about the ES 300h giving you the same feeling as a very happy occasion (a party, a wedding and the likes), and it has done that successfully.', 'Some of our favourite design bits from the car include the new grille which features vertical slats instead of the horizontal ones on the previous model.', 'The headlamps are sleek and feature two distinct design elements - the three-barrel LED lamps which are underlined by LED indicators and the signature L-shaped LED DRLs which have their own distinct position in the headlamp cluster.', '', 'The ORVMs seem to jut out of the body more than usual and are sculpted to feel like they have been shaped by the wind.', 'The side view reveals a fastback/notchback design, a first for the ES series in its 7-generation history. The body surfaces are subtle, with no visible contours on the side except the shoulder line below the windows and the crease along the bottom of the doors. This dazzles the eye as the surfaces catch light differently at different viewing angles.', 'The 18-inch, 15-spoke aluminium wheels are a work of art and complement the stylish exterior design of the ES 300h.', '', 'The large windows end in a hofmeister kink, with the quarter panels specifically designed to let more light in for the rear passengers. The chrome surround is subtle all-around but becomes chunky at the kink, adding a bit to the sense of occasion.', '', 'The rear design is all about making this hunk of a sedan look rather slim and surprisingly sporty - there’s a hint of the LC 500 two-door coupe here. Highlights include all-LED taillamps which wrap around the corners, the boot lip spoiler and the chrome strip which runs along the bottom of the bumper.', 'There’s also the argument that the ES’ design stands out because of the rather stiff-upper-lip-like design adopted by the competition. Nonetheless, there’s no denying that the Lexus ES 300h has a presence unmatched by its rivals.', 'Its swooping design is also deceptive. The new ES300h is larger than the older car - it is 65mm longer, 45mm wider and has a 50mm longer wheelbase. But with a 5mm reduction in height, the ES300h now looks much bigger than it actually is. For comparison, the ES is 88mm shorter than the E-Class long wheelbase, 261mm narrower than the 5 Series and has the shortest wheelbase in its class. Look at it in isolation and you would be rubbing your eyes in disbelief at those numbers.', 'While our test cars were donned a rather sombre Deep Blue paint scheme, the ES 300h can be had in nine colours including the exciting Red Mica or the all-new Ice Ecru.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20180917_191304/560/lexus0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['Interior', 'The sense of occasion continues on the inside, with the ES 300h taking inspiration from the LS for a premium cabin.', 'The front half is distinctively divided into two, an easy on the eyes, ergonomic driver’s cockpit and a comfortable passenger side.', '', 'While it may look a tad busy at first, the dashboard was designed to keep most of the instruments at eye-level for the driver. The two rotary wheels on either side of the instrument cluster can be used to change the driving modes (Eco, Standard, Sport) and toggle the traction control. Even the instrument cluster and the centre display are placed on the same height, so that one does not have to look too far for important information. The head-up display, offered as standard, is also informative enough and doesn’t need the driver to take his eyes off the road.', '', 'If you are not sitting in the 14-way adjustable driver seat though, the cabin has enough design details and features to keep you entertained and comfortable. The seats have partial leather covers, featuring harder leather on the outer corners, while the centre gets softer fabric. This makes the seats comfortable and cosseting at the same time. The front seats can be cooled or warmed, and there are individual ACs for both the front occupants - operated by conventional buttons rather than a touch unit.', 'The door handles are sleek, made of a single-piece soft-touch plastic and are nice to operate. Lexus claims that the armrests on the doors and the centre armrests (fixed one at the front, foldable one at the rear) which feature textured fabric covers, are more comfortable on longer drives than leather-covered ones. In our short time with the car, they did seem well placed but the claims about being comfortable over a longer journey remains to be verified.', '', 'The rear seat experience is more about peace of mind rather than outright entertainment. There are no seatback-mounted screens or wireless headphones here. Flip down the centre seatback and it transforms into a useful centre armrest, with controls for the rear climate control, seat heating, multimedia controls and the rear sunshade. The sunshades on the side windows are manually deployable, but are nicely shaped - even the quarter panel glass gets its own shade!', '', 'The rear seat angle can be changed by as much as 8-degrees and helps in making the cabin feel spacious. In fact, the front passenger seat can be pushed forward using buttons accessible from the rear seat to free up even more legroom.', '', 'There is one aspect where the ES 300h really suffers in terms of space, and that is the headroom on offer. The front occupants suffer the most. Its low roof, along with the inclusion of a sunroof, eat into their space. At a maximum of 915mm, it is one of the lowest in the segment. Rear passengers fare better, but at 895mm, it is 15mm less than the Jaguar XF and the 25mm less than the BMW 5 Series.', 'The Rich Cream interior leather upholstery you see here adds to the sense of space. But, as you might have guessed, it is the most susceptible to dirt among the four upholstery options available (Topaz Brown, Chateau and Black). Other customisation options include one of three trim colours - Shimamoku Black, Shimamoku Brown and Bamboo.', '', 'Talking of space, better packaging, thanks to the new GA-K platform, and the compact battery pack have made the boot a lot more useful than the previous model. The 204-cell battery pack now sits under the rear seats rather than the boot, which has not only allowed the luggage space to go up to a huge 454 litres, but has also freed up enough space to fit a full sized tyre shod on the same stylish 18-inch alloy wheel!', '', 'The Gadgets', 'The wow factor inside the Lexus ES 300h is courtesy the two all-digital screens on the dash and the 17-speaker 1800W Mark Levinson surround system.', '', 'The 7-inch TFT instrument cluster and the 12.3-inch multimedia screen conduct a synchronised start-up routine. The centrepiece of the instrument cluster is a round digital screen which can either be the speedometer or the tachometer, changing colour and information displayed depending on the driving mode chosen.', '', 'The 12.3-inch multimedia screen can be controlled only via a touchpad on the centre console, which is not the easiest to use on the move. We can understand that a touchscreen based system would have been too far from both the front seats to be used easily, but it begs for an easier user interface. The system has built in navigation, trip details, a dedicated detailed display for the hybrid system, multimedia options and others. That said, it is not the most intuitive interface to use as there are no guides on the screen to show you how to access them.', '', 'And then there are the limited connectivity options. In an age where many manufacturers are moving to smartphone-based interfaces for Android and Apple users, Lexus has stuck to offering only Bluetooth and Miracast connectivity along with DVD player/AM/FM/USB/Aux-in. Concerns about limited connectivity are thrown right out of the big windows as soon as you play music. It’s so good and powerful that it could double up as the sound system at a mini-concert!'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/930x620/20180917_191945/560/lexus0.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

But a quick look at the Daytona Grey colour option tells you that Tata is merely nudging you to notice the difference and not shouting it in your ears.', 'There’s a redesigned grille with ‘tri-arrow’ detailing, complemented by more of the same on the front bumper. Other than these design updates, the matte aqua-colour accents around the grille, fog lamps and wheels, and the subtle highlights on the bumpers are all that separate an electric Tigor from its petrol cousin. We like how Tata hasn’t gone overboard with the chrome here; an underline for the window line, a splash on the door handle and boot — just right. Highlight elements like the halogen projector headlamps, daytime running lamps, and clear lens tail lamps have been carried over unchanged.', '', 'An obvious change compared to the petrol Tigor are the wheels. The EV has to make do with tiny 14-inch steel wheels that try their best to mimic alloy wheels. It doesn’t help that the design is identical to the old model of the Tiago NRG. We’d have loved to see the Tigor’s 15-inch two-tone alloy wheels here.', 'It’s obvious that the Tigor’s strong design plays in the EV’s favour. If making a statement is your thing, the Tigor EV does it in more ways than one.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/roadTestimages/816x544/20210908_002834/736/tata0.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['Step inside the cabin of the Tigor EV, and you’d quickly notice some more blue accents on the dashboard. They underline the AC vents and find their way to the instrument cluster too. Another differentiator comes in the form of blue tri-arrow motifs on the fabric upholstery. Save for these, the cabin remains identical to the standard Tigor.', '', 'And that might just be a disappointment to some. The hard and scratchy plastic is acceptable on an entry-level sedan that costs under Rs 10 lakh, not over. Tata could’ve considered upping the experience here by offering a leather-wrap for the steering wheel, leatherette upholstery for the seat, and door pads.', 'Space and practicality haven’t been impinged, thankfully. Getting into a comfortable driving position is relatively straightforward with a height-adjustable driver’s seat and tilt-adjust for the steering. Like the standard car, the Tigor EV has ample space for four six-footers. You can manage to squeeze in a third occupant at the rear provided everyone isn’t sized as generously. Also, rear-adjustable headrests and rear AC vents seem like silly misses at this price point.', '', 'The only real cutback is in the boot space. Where the standard Tigor has 419-litres of space to offer, the Tigor EV has 316 litres. This is due to the raised boot floor and the spare wheel being placed in the boot. Tata’s offering a puncture repair kit with the Tigor EV, so you can ditch the spare wheel if you really need the boot space. With the spare wheel gone, boot space goes up to 376 litres.', 'Features and Technology', 'There’s no deletion in the features list compared to the petrol Tigor. The top-spec XZ+ variant gets features like keyless entry, push-button start, and automatic climate control. However, a few more features over the standard Tigor, including auto-dimming IRVM, front armrest, and cruise control, would’ve been great.', '', 'Tata is also offering connected car technology that can be accessed via the ‘Z Connect’ app. This application lets you access data (such as car range) and start the air-conditioning remotely.', 'You also get a 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

Hence, this EQS is claimed to be the most aerodynamic production car in the world. This helps it offer better efficiency and performance as well."", '', ""Science apart, the way the car looks is also impressive. Its large dimensions (almost as long as the LWB S-Class) combined with the spaceship-like shape make it an alien on the road that people around can get enough of! Deal in the quirky details like the star-studded grille, flush door handles, frameless doors and squiggly taillamps, and you have a car that everyone will take notice of. It's a very mature design, but with youthful elements to help it appeal to buyers of all ages. And of course, it has much more road appeal than the S-Class.""], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/635a640d1a80e.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The EQS is as much a spaceship on the inside as it is on the outside. The white leatherette upholstery, the wooden finish on the centre console and the dashboard in the three large screens transcend you to the future of luxury.', '', ""The quality all around the cabin is excellent and won't give you a chance to complain. It will feel like home even to an S-Class owner. The leather, door pads, carpets and even the centre console feels premium. There are certain edges which could have been better finished - like the rear armrest lock and the panel interlocks in the dashboard, considering this is a one-and-a-half crore rupee car. But one can easily look beyond these as the centre attraction is big and in your face."", '', 'The dashboard is made up of three screens. The ones on either side measure 12.3 inches and the one in the middle a massive 17.7 inches. Now, I am not a fan of large touchscreens in cars, especially the ones replacing buttons, but this setup shows promise. The display resolution on screens is excellent and can easily rival any flagship tablet. The driver’s display has various modes which can be customized to infinity and beyond. Plus the driver also gets the most detailed and vibrant heads-up display I have ever seen in a car.', '', 'The display on the co-driver’s seat uses an older Mercedes UI and can only be used if the seat is occupied by a passenger. It controls basic functions like media, navigation and more but is purely a gimmick, as all of these functions can still be performed by the larger central display as well.', '', 'Speaking of the larger central display, this has to be the best display ever put in a production car. The screen is bright, the colours are vibrant and the interface is simple to use. It uses navigation as the home display and the other menus over it when required. And there is so much functionality in that one screen that it can easily take weeks to figure it all out. But even with so many menus, the straightforward layout means reaching a particular option is just a matter of logic.', '', 'Other features include a 4-zone climate control system; a 15-speaker sound system; ventilated, heated and massaged front seats; gesture control for media and lights; panoramic sunroof; active ambient lighting that travels throughout the cabin like a spaceship; a very powerful air purifier and one-touch biometric authentication for the entire infotainment system. And all of these features work perfectly.', '', 'The connected car tech here is also quite advanced. You can schedule the car to start at a particular time each morning and cool the cabin, to charge only at a particular time each day when the charger is plugged in, among all the other usual bits.', '', 'However, there are two notable inconveniences. Firstly, the blowers for the rear AC vents are placed just behiend the dashboard, and they can get really loud. Lowering the fan speed meant not enough cooling for the rear seat passengers. And second, the sunroof curtain is a very thin cloth which allows for a lot of heat to come into the cabin. This can get uncomfortable if you are travelling, even for short distances, on sunny days.', '', ""To be called the S-Class of electric cars is a really big deal. And while the EQS has the potential to fulfil that, it does fall short in the rear seat experience. The EQS gets the basics all right. The seats are really comfortable, the cabin is very spacious and the quality all around is impeccable. It's even drenched in features like reclining seats, a personal tablet to control media, personal zones for climate control, ventilated seats and a cocoon of ambient lights. And standalone, it's a really good rear-seat experience."", '', 'Its shortcoming lies in the name. Particularly the S in the name. Compared to the S-Class, it misses on the extravagance of soft-close doors, massaged rear seats, window shades, sunshade control in the rear tablet, or a “boss button” to adjust the front seat from the rear.

Now, with the facelift, Citroën has only improvised on the SUV’s aesthetics by giving it a few nips and tucks, majorly relating to the front fascia.', '', 'The 2022 Citroën C5 Aircross has done away with the split LED headlights for a more conventional-looking setup, which houses the double LED DRLs. Then, there are two chrome-studded lines connecting the LED DRLs and running up to the double chevron logo in the middle and a gloss black finish for the grille. Lower down, it gets a mildly redone bumper with a new skid plate and bigger air dams.', '', 'In profile, the SUV remains quite similar to the pre-facelift version, save for the newly designed 18-inch dual-tone alloy wheels (which look snazzier than the older set). Apart from that, the C5 Aircross continues to feature the chunky black body cladding with the trapezoidal element, roof rails and the C-shaped chrome window beltline.', '', 'At the back, there isn’t much of revisions either as the SUV is still flaunting the old Citroën logo and the ‘C5 Aircross’ badging. The only significant change comes in the form of updated taillights with new LED elements. Citroën is offering the C5 Aircross in four monotone (Pearl Nera Black, Pearl White, Eclipse Blue and Cumulus Grey) and three dual-tone (with a black roof) options with the last three shades.'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg2.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/6337c39873447.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'Citroën has reserved a bulk of the updates for the interior of the C5 Aircross. The first noticeable difference is the revised dashboard, which is now home to a free-floating 10-inch touchscreen system. To integrate the display, the carmaker has had to play around with the central AC vents and they are now stacked horizontally below the infotainment unit. There are also a few keys above the wireless phone charging pad which have a tactile feel.', '', 'Although Citroën has fixed one of the ergonomic issues that the pre-facelift model had (its cabin was more oriented towards left-hand drive markets) by placing the revised drive shifter nearer the driver side, the push-button start/stop switch continues to be in the same place. Apart from that, the SUV’s cabin is still practical enough as it has a couple of cup holders, front centre armrest with a deep storage area, two USB sockets, and a compartment in the centre console to stow your knick knacks.', '', 'The cabin continues with its all-black theme while featuring soft-touch material almost all throughout the dashboard, centre console and door pads. It now also gets contrast blue stitching on the dashboard and door handles which complement the SUV’s black-themed interior, all of which lends the cabin a more premium and upmarket feel. While the previous squarish pattern is gone from the upholstery, the side AC vents are still unchanged and split into two squares and so is the steering wheel.', 'Speaking of seats, the upholstery continues to be one of the strong points of the C5 Aircross even today. Citroën says it has made the seats fluffier by 15 percent, which adds to the snug seating comfort.', '', 'Both the front and rear seats are well bolstered and contoured making it comfortable to sit in. It’s also quite easy to find the suitable driving position with the help of the power-adjustable driver seat, which is absent on the passenger side. Continuing from the pre-facelift, the new C5 Aircross has loads of headroom and shoulder room while offering decent knee room. The rear row gets the individual sliding seats, which even recline and fold down as before. So seating three adults of the similar body proportions abreast in the second row shouldn’t be a challenge even on longer trips.', '', 'One big update with the facelift came in the form of the new 10-inch touchscreen system. While the display is pretty crisp and has easy-to-read fonts, it does take a second to load the requested task. Another miss in the infotainment is the lack of a home screen but Citroën has provided it with some touch-enabled shortcut keys below the AC vents for the most useful functions. Thankfully, the touchscreen does come with support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay (not wireless though).', '', 'The facelifted C5 Aircross also packs features such as a panoramic sunroof, wireless phone charger, a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display, dual-zone climate control, and a powered tailgate. Other equipment on the list includes push-button start/stop, auto-headlights and wipers, cruise control, powered driver’s seat, and a six-speaker music system.

For starters, selecting a destination also tells you the predicted state-of-charge on arrival. Also, the navigation is relayed on the digital driver’s display.', '', 'Speaking of which, the driver’s display is legible with crisp graphics.

There’s oodles of road presence and you will get your fair share of attention on the road.', 'In typical Honda fashion, the design isn’t taking any unnecessary risks. It’s simple, strong and powerful. The connection to Honda’s global lineup of SUVs is amply evident in the flat-nose with a large gloss black grille. Pair that with a high-set bonnet, and a thick slab of chrome above the full-LED headlamps — you’ve got a face that exudes confidence.', 'The side profile seems almost too simplistic. Save for the interesting elements on the lower half of the doors, the profile is clean — devoid of any sharp creases. It’s tall height is also highlighted when viewed from this angle, and the 17” dual tone wheels also stand out.', '', 'From the rear, the obvious highlight is the connected tail lamp design element. We wish this entire unit was LED and not just the brake lamps.', 'In terms of size, the numbers are right where they should be. It’s standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its arch rivals — the Creta, Seltos and the Grand Vitara. The number that’s likely to get your attention, however, is the large 220mm of ground clearance. Nothing speaks ‘for India’ in the design as much as this does!'], 'Exterior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64c7f6107964f.jpg'}","{'Interior': ['', 'The doors of the Elevate open nice and wide. Getting in and out won’t be a task, even for the elderly. You tend to ‘walk’ into the cabin, which is easy on the knees.', 'Once in, the classy tan-black color combination has you saying ‘classy’ almost immediately. Honda has chosen to keep the theme subdued and sombre, with dark grey highlights around the AC vents (instead of the usual chrome) and dark grey stitching for the upholstery too. The wooden insert on the dash gets a dark shade too. The wrap around effect of the tan from the dashboard ‘spilling over’ onto the door pads is executed neatly too, making the cabin feel a lot more cohesive.', 'Honda seems to have hit the nail on the head in terms of material quality. The plastic used on the dashboard top, AC vents and the climate control interface seems high quality. Soft touch leatherette on the dashboard and door pads do their bit in amping up the experience.', '', 'Let’s now talk about space. The seating position is tall. In fact, even at its lowest setting, the front seats’ height is quite high. The obvious advantage to this is that you get a clear view of the nose — important if you’re new to driving. An obvious flipside is for those taller than 6ft or those who wear turbans, you’d find yourself close to the roof. A non-sunroof model should (in theory) have better headroom at the front.', ""Inside the cabin, there's no shortage of practicality - cupholders in the center console, storage in the armrest, and bottle holders in the door pockets. In addition, there are thin storage slots for keeping your phone or keys."", 'On the passenger side, the portion below the central AC vents juts out by design. This might brush your\xa0 your knee or shin which will have you move the seat a notch further back than usual. Thankfully, even doing that leaves plenty of legroom for the rear seat passengers.', '', ""The rear knee room is among the best in the segment — a six footer like me was able to comfortably fit behind a 6’5” tall driver. The floor under the seats is raised, turning it into a natural footrest. There are no complaints about headroom, either. The roof liner is scooped from the sides, creating a bit more space. Cabin width is decent. Three people can squeeze in if needed. However, there's neither a headrest nor a 3-point seat belt for the middle occupant."", 'This cabin is perfect for 4 adults and 1 child, and the spacious trunk will easily swallow the weekend luggage of 5 people. You get 458 liters of space, and the rear seats split 60:40 for added versatility.', '', 'The top-spec version of the Elevate brings with it all that you’d use on a daily basis. Basics such as keyless entry, push-button start stop, tilt-telescopic adjustment for the steering wheel and a height-adjustable driver’s seat are in place. Other notable features include a wireless charger, climate control, rear AC vents, and a sunroof.', ""The highlight is the new 10.25-inch touchscreen, which Honda is introducing for the first time. The interface is simple, responsive, and has good resolution. It's definitely better than the Honda City's infotainment system. With it you get Wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay and an 8-speaker sound system."", '', 'The second highlight is the part-digital driver display, borrowed from the City. Analogue and digital display blend seamlessly into one cohesive cluster. Here too, graphics are sharp, and all vital information is available at a glance.', 'There are some misses too, however. A panoramic sunroof, front seat ventilation, or a 360-degree camera would’ve made it a little more lucrative. Surprisingly, there are no type-C chargers in the car. You get a couple of USB type-A ports up front along with a 12V socket, whereas the rear occupants only get a 12V socket to charge their phones. Also, given the roomy rear, Honda should’ve added rear window sunshades.'], 'Interior Image URL': 'https://stimg.cardekho.com/images/cms/carnewsimages/editorimages/64c7f65d3b204.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,

That said, here too the experience is identical to the BMW X1 itself and this step-up in quality and the sense of richness in the cabin is becoming a standard with new-generation BMWs.', 'The cockpit has also been designed thoughtfully, with the placement of the cupholders, upright wireless phone charger and under-armrest storage tray being things that will make your long term ownership experience more convenient. Front passengers also benefit from the inclusion of very supportive seats with extendable seat bases for improved underthigh support.', '', 'As for cabin space, the iX1 is spacious enough to seat 4 passengers comfortably. Type-C charge ports are available in both seat rows and rear passengers also get AC vents. However, there are two misses vs the BMW X1. First, the underthigh support is average.
